## Avenues For Analysis

- [ ] Toxicity analysis (100 labeled, 1000 unlabeled) on dataset equally split among demographics.
  - [ ] Try various cutoff values for toxic/non-toxic to obtain better results.
- [ ] Other category analysis on dataset equally split among demographics.
- [ ] Context switching (adding spanish/mandarin words) to trick the API.
- [ ] Community niche language like gaming (more desensitized), music (explicit lyrics), novels (made up words/names)
- [ ] Message alterations: splitting up sentences/character substitution.
