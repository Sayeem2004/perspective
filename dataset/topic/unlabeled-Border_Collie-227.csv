Border Collies are such wonderful dogs. They're from the Anglo-Scottish border region!
Oh cool, so that's why they're called border collies!
Exactly! They were also bred for intelligence and obedience which is why they are so smart.
Oh awesome! How long ago were they bred?
Quite a while ago but I'm not sure the exact year. It's amazing how they are the most intelligent of all domestic dogs though.
Oh awesome! How long ago were they bred?
Like I said, I don't know the exacts! They're very intelligent, energetic, and athletic dogs for herding sheep so probably a good amount of time.
Ah they must have been around for a while since there have been sheep herders for forever there! Was the book Lassie about a border collie?
No it was not. The Border Collie is usually a medium sized dog so I can see how you could mix that up.
Oh I see. Do border collies have anything else they're especially known for being good at in addition to herding sheep?
I have a border collie for livestock herding
I'm sure your border collie is highly intelligent and obedient as is this breed.
Yes she is the smartest dog I have ever seen
yes, they an fantastically intelligent domestic breed of dog
My border collie was never taught to herd she knew how instinctively
It takes a highly energetic breed such as yours to successfully herd.
She is very good at it its almost like its her purpose in life she enjoys it
For a medium size dog, their coat sure does shed a lot !
I really wish that I could own pets but I have severe allergies.  Do you have pets?
Yes, I have a Border Collie. They were developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region my home country.
Wow, what a coincidence I remember having a Border Collie growing up and many other type of animals. They are very mild-mannered dogs.
I run a horse farm so I adopt it for it's intelligence and obedience. It helps keeps the horses in check.
That's very interesting to know.  Did you have to train your Border Collie?
Not really being the most intelligent of all domestic dogs she was able to pick up on everything her self. 
I'm sure that's a big help around your farm.  This is going to make me want to look into hypoallergenic dogs.  My children have been begging for a pet.
Careful, my vet claimed that there is no basis to the claims that certain dog breeds are hypoallergenic 
I love my Border Collies! They are such a great breed, known for their obedience and intelligence. 
They're super cute to! I actually grew up with a Great Dane, and hes not nearly as well trained as most Border Collies i've seen
Great Danes are really cool dogs too! I like Border Collies because they're thought to be the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. They're also a great working breed!
Didn't they used to be used for work on family homesteads? How many Collies do you have?
Exactly! They were developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding sheep. I have two, they're my babies! They do have a downfall though!
Whats the downside of owning a Border Collie? 
They shed a ton! Even they're medium sized dogs, they shed a lot because of their super thick coats. I'm constantly vacuuming! Do your Great Danes shed?
Holy cow yes! I swear everytime you pet him you could make a coat out of the fur that falls off its kind of ridiculous, its not to bad this time of year once it starts to get cold again, but its really bad at the end of winter.
Haha! Just like my dogs. My dogs are both black and white, which is the most commonly seen color for their breed. So at least it's easy to spot the fur on the floor! 
Its the other way around for me, My Dog has brown fur and we have brown carpet, so it just means we have to vacuum 2 or 3 times a week, especially the couches, as he thinks hes a small dog and uses the couch as a bed.
Border collies are one of the best dogs in my opinion, i recently had one pass away at the age of 13
I agree. They are intelligent dogs and originally developed in the Anglo-Scottish border area.
The one we had was really smart and so loyal. Do you know alot about them?
I don't know too much, but my friend used to have one too. It was a great dog. I've heard they are the most intelligent of domesticated dogs.
Ours had a love for children like none i've ever seen before, when my little girl was sick our dog would literally not leave her side.
That's amazing. Dogs are the best. I may get one in the future, and I am thinking of a Border Collie. I heard they are energetic.
Yes, They are energetic and playful but they also listen and train very well 
I've heard they generally have a variety of coats. Most common are black, tan, and white. What color was yours?
I always wanted to get a border collie. The border collie is a herding dog breed, that was bred in the Anglo-Scottish border region to herd livestock, particularly sheep. Interesting.
why would you want a border collie, do you own sheep?
Haha, no sheep - I just like collies a lot. I guess they were bred because they were so intelligent and obedient, which sounds about right to me.
well they have super long hair and shed like crazy, there's a lot of other intelligent dogs out there too
I bet they do! Collies are still employed for herding livestock throughout the world to this day.
but you don't own livestock
I like collies, true I don't have any livestock haha. Collies have a thick coat and it sheds often, and they are about medium sized. I don't want a really big dog.
maybe you should buy some livestock so you can watch the dog chase them around
Black and white coats are the most common colors in collies, but it can appear in almost any color seen in dogs.
really, I thought they were orange and white
Border collies are such awesome dogs.
Border Collies really are fantastic. They are herding and working dogs. 
They must be really smart, too.
You bet. The border collie was bread for their obedience and intelligence.
Do you know any other smart breeds?
Not like the border collie. They can often be found competing in dog sports and sheepdog trials. They are very athletic and energetic.
I bet they are.  What else can you tell me?
The border collie often have a thinck coat that sheds often. They tend to be medium sized.
Shedding is no fun to take care of.
No doubt about that. The border collie is used by farmer all over the world still to herd livestock.
i would like to adopt a border collie
They are known for the intelligence and obedience.
really? that's really good to know. where did this breed come from?
They came from the Anglo scottish border region
interesting. are they used for hunting or racing?
They are mostly known for herding livestock.
do you know the primary colors of their fur?
They can have different colors it seems.
What is border collie?
The border collie is a working breed of dog that was developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region. It's usually used for herding livestock, like sheep.
I like dogs
I like dogs too. Somtimes I like to watch those agility competitions, like the Fisbee Dog World Championship.
Really? I would watch too
Yeah, they're a lot of fun. There are major competitions held all over the world.
Please mention some 
There was one that I watched this summer - the Purina Pro Challenge. My favorite part was when they threw a toy into the water, and the dogs had to jump to get it. The dog who jumped the furthest and caught the toy successfully was the winner.
I have a Border Collie names Max! I just love dogs
Do  you know much about the Border Collie which is a working and herding dog
I dont I just now Mac is really fluffy. Wasnt Lassie  Collie?
Yes he was.  They were developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock, especially sheep
Do you know how long ago they species was discovered?
Im not sure..but these dogs are specifically bred for their  intelligence and obediance
That is really cool! Max knows a lot of tricks so that makes a lot of since.
they are usually medium size dogs with a moderate amount of coat.  It is often thick and sheds often
I love border collies, such smart dogs.
Yes, they are smart dogs indeed. They were specifically bred for loyalty and compliance.
Oh really? I love how beautiful they look.
I think their true beauty is that they are considered the most intelligent of ALL domestic dogs!
Yea its crazy they are insanely smart.
It didn't just happen overnight though. The border collie's behavior was shaped by millennia of contact with humans and their lifestyles. 
I hope to have one as a pet someday.
Well if you ever consider having one as pet someday, be prepared because they are medium-sized dogs with a thick coat that sheds often!
I have two border collie dogs, do you like them? They were specifically bred for intelligence and obedience! 
Yes, I actually used to have one. He now lives with my ex girlfriend. Do you work yours? Ours worked on my horse ranch.
No, i live in the city :) I love them though, they're even considered as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs.
Yes, mine could go to the fridge and bring back a water bottle then head out to work the horses.
That is actually amazing! i need to teach mine how to do that haha. As well as intelligence, they are also extremely energetic, acrobatic and athletic. They often complete with great success i sheepdog trials and dog sports so its no surprise that yours were good at working the horses.
It's so cool to learn new things about my fur baby. I knew she was smart but did not know how smart. 
They are an absolute gift to humans! They continue to be employed for their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world! :) 
I think they live to be old for dogs as well. As a kid we had one that died at 18 years old
I really love Border Collie's, I study dogs for a living, I know that these breeds were specifically bred for superior intelligence and obedience.
I like them but have never had much interaction with them. I've seen them doing tasks on tv, also. They do seem very smart
indeed they are very smart, Border Collies are usually employed in the work of herding livestock throughout the world, Truly making them a farmers best friend. 
What else do you know about them? I enjoy watching them do the obstacle courses. 
Well I know that they actually have a double coat that varies greatly from smooth to rough and its fur is usually curled.
I didn't know that, it's interesting. Is there a reason for their fur being like that?
Its just the way its fur grows, We believe its to help keep it warmer in colder climates but that has been highly debated. 
It would seem to make sense because of some of the places they herd. Is there temperament rather friendly? 
Well since they are most often cited as one of the most intelligent of all domestic dogs, Id say yes. If they are raised right. 
Do you happen to know where the breed came from? I used to know but can't remember the specific country.
I have two border collies. I use them to herd my livestock.
what are their names and how old are they?
Bart and Lisa. They barley a year old, but they are highly intelligent and acrobatic.
thats awsome, what type of animals do you herd?
Mostly sheep, they perform in a herding event called sheepdog trials.
where is that located at? how many teams compete?
These trials take place all over the world like in the USA, Canada, and the UK.
Oh that is nice, i never heard of it before.
My border collies are the smartest, most obedient dogs.
My mother has a border collie, but I don't know much about them myself. Are they usually very obedient?
Yes, they are.  They typically dominate sheep dog trials and dog sports.  Is your mother's smart?
She seems pretty smart, actually. I've never seen a sheep dog trial, but I think it would be really interesting to watch!
oh they are great.  The dogs work sheep on a range of hilly unfenced land.  You should check it out.
Now I want to start working with my mother's border collie. Are they hard to train?
Not terribly hard.  Especially herding.  It's simply a modified predatory behavior that is already in them.
Wow, so it's partially instinctive? I guess that explains why my mother's dog is so smart, even though she's young.
Border Collie is such a cute breed 
I love border collies! They are known to be intelligent and obedient. 
They are ! I wonder if they are good with kids
They certainly seem like they would be, as they are highly intelligent, extremely energetic, acrobatic and athletic!
Do you know the history of Border Collie?
They were developed originally in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock.
how interesting! I would've never guessed 
They are also often cited as the most intelligent breed of all domestic dog breeds, which is crazy because I had a toy poodle and I though they were the smartest breed!
Poodles are so beautiful! I love that breed as well
I'm a dog lover, I just love all dogs! 
Good evening, How are you doing tonight. I really like Border Collies. Do you have one?
Good evening, and yes I do.  It's quite apparent that they are bred for their intelligence and obedience.
Yes, I agree. They are beautiful too. What is your dogs name?
I named him Anglo in honor of the breed being developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region.
I love that name! We do not have one, but defiantly would consider it. Are they good with kids?
You should definitely consider it.  They are good with kids, but keep in mind, they typically have a thick coat that sheds frequently.
That is good to know, especially since I do have allergies. 
If there is any chance that you live on a farm it would be ideal for a border collie.  They love to herd livestock.
We do not, we live in a mountain community. I would love to live on a farm though, it is one of my husbands dreams. 
A mountain community would be great too.  They are very athletic and acrobatic.
I currently have 2 dogs. They are border collies.
Wow they must be a bit of work. Border Collies are bred for intelligence and obedience.
Yes they are incredibly intelligent and do whatever I say for the most part.
I wish my dog did what I said! He's so stubborn. Border Collies are the most intelligent of all dogs.
I'd agree with that. I've had lots of dogs but the ones i have now are way smarter.
They still work as herding dogs! I love watching documentaries about them. They're so fast and clever
Yes they help me out on my farm with the sheep.
I like their fur and black and white colouring. It looks very smart.
I am thinking about adopting a border collie
Border collies are my favorite breed! There such good work dogs.
Have you ever owned one?
Yes, I have. They're very energetic and intelligent dogs.
That's great to hear! Are they easy to train?
They are one of the smarted of all dog breeds, so yes, they are very easy to train.
Great. I feel even better about my choice, then.
Just keep in mind, they are a work dog, and tend to be extremely energetic. 
I will make sure to keep her busy to burn off energy.
I also hope you aren't afraid of some dog hair! They have a thick coat and shed often. 
The Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region
I have always liked collies!  They are a pretty dog!  Do you have one?
I do. They are a very intelligent and obedient breed of dog.
Are they a good dog if you have kids as well?
They are actually very good with kids!
That's good since I have little ones!  Isn't that the breed of dog on the show "Lassie"?
Indeed. Lassie was a fictional character created by Eric Knight that was a femal Rough Collie dog. 
That's what I thought!  That was a great show!
She was a Rough Collie, though, which has to do with the length of her coat.
Interesting!  I never knew that!  Is one better than the other?
Have you ever seen a border collie? It is a herding dog that was bred in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock.
I've never owned a border collie, but my ex girl friend did. I'm more of a cat person myself.
I see. Border collies were bred specifically for intelligence and obedience. It's hard to get a cat to follow orders!
That's true. My cat just likes to snuggle. She's lying on my keyboard at the moment. Border collies are too big for that.
Can't dispute that. Is it really true that cats have nine lives?
I don't think so. She hasn't died yet though so maybe she does.
I know many people have cats for companionship and also to hunt for mice!
She likes to hunt bugs. She hasn't found a mouse yet though.
I have two border collies, very nice working herding dogs.
Wow lucky you! I love that breed.
They are specifically bred for their obedience and intelligence. Very nice pairing.
I know, they are the smartest dog breed right?
I think so, they are also amazing at dog sports, and sheepdog trials because of that intelligence.
It's crazy how smart they are!
I love their double coat which varies from smooth and rough and even curly.
I never heard of that, honestly.
Sure and even though white and black is the common fur color you can breed them for any color you want so full customization.
Wow, really? That's so cool!
My family loves dogs! Currently, we have two Border Collies -- Pancho and Lefty!
I love border collies. I've heard they are good at working and herding.
Both a plus and a minus -- sometimes they want to herd things that don't *want* to be herded! But they are sweethearts, for sure.
They were bred primarily for their intelligence and obedience. 
They are super-smart, for sure. Happily, obedience is a strong suit -- and deeply appreciated, considering some of the wild child dogs we've had before ;-)
Many people say they are the smartest of all domestic dogs!
We also love boxers -- do you have dogs?
Yes i have two boxers! Im partial to short-haired breeds of dogs.
Oh, my heart! What are their names? Fawn, brindle...I'm curious! I miss ours!
Their names are Smooch and Dribbles. They are fawn and have smooth coats.
Do you like border collies? I have two!
