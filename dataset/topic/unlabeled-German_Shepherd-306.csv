I  own a German Shepherd, but i wish that i had gotten a Caucasian Shepherd instead.  
Yeah? I agree the Caucasian Shepherd is a sweet dog! They're so large and very popular in Russia. How old is your dog?
8 Months. If you want him you can have him.  Even a Scottish terrier would be better than this dog.
Ha I'll take him off your hands! I lover German Shepherds. They're a relatively new breed dating from 1899, but they're so smart!
Great. You can pick him up this afternoon.  I think i will really get a peekapoodle, a cross between a pekinese and a poodle.
Ha, deal lord... that sounds like an odd mix. I like the German Shepherds because of their strength, obedience and train-ability. I'm also disabled and they're excellent to assist me. 
i'm glad you have an assistant.  Well, i have finally made up my mind.  It is going to be a dachpinscher  for me, a cross between a dachshund and a doberman pinscher.  A vicious little dog to protect me.
I do like the dachshund as well. Their little legs are so cute. I like the long hair ones. I would call him Vienna Sausage.
I have one now that is about 14 years old and has debilitating epilepsy.  That prescribed her barbiturates, so now she is high as a kite all day.  She is happy, though.
I own four German Shepherds. Do you have any dogs?
no buy german shepards are great breeds of large dogs
Yes, they're very smart. They often use them as police dogs.
yep they are german working dogs, very smart breed
Are they actually good at being a shepherd? Like their name suggests?
yes they are part of the herding group of dogs
Okay interesting! I usually think of Boarder Collies when I think of dogs that herd animals. 
yea they are kind of a new breed from 1899
I didn't know they were so new. Do they actually come from Germany?
yea they do its awesome
I like German Shepherds. They're a fun medium to large-sized working dog and I hope I can get one some day
They are great dogs.  Very intelligent and friendly
Yes, and I'm surprised they are a relatively new breed of dog. they have only been around since 1899
Yes, you would think they would have been around longer.  They are great for working dogs.  They are used as companion dogs and search and rescue, among others
They are great for search and rescue, due to their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience
They do have some health issues however that need watching out for.  Hip Dysplasia is common with German Shepards
That is unfortunate but not surprising, given that they are longer than tall, with a proportion of 10 to 8 1/2
They got their start from hearding sheep.  I guess that is why they are such good working dogs
Probably. They don't serve as working dogs though, they are very popular as pets. They're the second-most registered breed by the Anerican Kennel Club
I have always thought they would make good pets.  Just like Rin Tin Tin
Hi, do you like dogs or cats? I have a German Shepherd pup.
I have two dogs! I love German Shepherds, I always wanted a White Shepherd, they are one of Europe's greatest achievements in my opinion. 
I don't think I've seen one. I'll have to look it up. Does it kind of look like a wolf or coyote?
They literally look snow white, its gorgeous, every shepherd has the chance to be white as of the late 19th century because it;s a recessive gene in their lineage.
Sounds gorgeous.  There is something regal and special about them.
I love that word regal, here in FL we have regal cinemas, Regal Entertainment Group originated in Tennessee though.
Are you near the beach, lol. Jelly.
Nah,the beach is only 30 mins away though, makes for a great escape after exams. LOL as the acronym is known today actually originated on a user messenger site called Usenet back in the early 2000s, they're a huge face-to-face communication platform now.
I didn't know that. I have heard of Usenet though.
Hello, I love German shepherd dogs and you?
My favorite dog,  they are officially known as German Shepherd Dogs?
Yes, I have a German shepherd in my house and she is pregnant
That is awesome, they make great rescue dogs too because they're so smart and obedient.
You are absolutely right, in my country they are dogs that cost a lot of money.
Will you sell the puppies or keep them and train them yourself? 
I will train them myself, my father is a police officer and adult dogs are taken to the police station
That is very cool. It is good that they get dogs that are not from puppy mills.
Yes, there in the police station they train them to detect drugs in some suitcase
They sure have great noses, they sniff bombs and cadavers, and people buried in natural disasters, too. 
I own 4 German Shepherds! Do you know anyone who has one?
I used to have a large-sized one that worked for me, but she died.
Aw, that's so sad. They're such intelligent dogs!
Yes, I have a disability, so mine used to assist me with various types of work.
Okay interesting! Do you have a new dog now?
No, i'm thinking about getting another German Shepard because they are so popular. According to the American Kennel Club they are the second most registered dog in the US.
Wow, I'm not surprised though. People have a bad misconception about them and think they're aggressive, but I've never encountered this before.. 
Me either, mine used to be highly obedient and easy to train.
Do you know how long people have domesticated this breed of dog?
Not long since they are a relatively new breed. Their origin dates back to around 1899.
I love German Shepherds! They are a large-sized breed of working dog which originated in Germany!
how big do they get ?
Well, German Shepherds are supposed to be longer than tall and their ideal proportion is 10 to 8/5.
oh wow, how long do they typically live ?
About 10 to 12 years and they are part of the Herding Group and were originally bred to herd sheep.
what are they used for today other than just pets ?
Well, due to their strength, intelligence, and trainability, they are preferred for many roles in police work and the military.
I think i have seen our police department use them in their K9 unit
You probably have! They are the second most registered breed at the American Kennel Club.
what is the first registered breed?
Hi! I own 4 cute german shepherds.
Really! That's cute ,why German Shepherd ,why not Italy shephard.Lol!
I just have liked them my whole life! Italy shephards sound interesting though! Do you have any dogs?
Yeah .I love police dogs.They are also called k-9
Yes! I have wondered what it would be like to work with them in a professional setting.
These dogs are used as detectives in criminal investigations .The search for dangerous weapons.
Yes! I wonder how many investigations on average they work a week
It all depends on the duties they are assigned.They originated in the 18th century.
Wow! It is neat to think they have been around for that long.
It would interest you to know thatThe German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel 
German Shepherds are a great breed.
Agreed, they are some of the smartest dogs right?
Yep, they are super intelligent and trainable
Must be why they are often used as police K9 dogs.
yea due to their strength and intelligence and trainability they are used for many jobs.
Apart from Police dogs, what are they used for then?
dissability assistance, search and rescue, and even acting.
Wow, they're so versatile and smart! Are they not used as therapy dogs?
That would fall under disability assistance.
Ah my bad, well nonetheless they're great dogs and I'd love to own one.
Hello, I wonder if you love dogs like I do.  I currently have 2 of them and my favorite is my German Shephard
I love German Shepherds too. They are a breed of medium to large sized working dogs.
yes that is correct and they also were  once known as the Alsatian in Britain and Ireland
Thats right and its hard to believe that this breed of dog is just a relatively new breed originating in 1899.
that is very hard to believe and they also are  the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and seventh-most registered breed
Well I can see why as they are such lovely dogs. Originally they were bred for herding sheeps.
Really, that's pretty interesting, I guess that's where the name Shepard comes from 
Good one, I didn't realise that. They are actually longer then they are tall but I think they have the perfect shape.
I agree they do have the perfect shape and what a wonderful protector for the family
I just a german shepherd puppy! I was scared she would be aggressive but she is the sweetest dog ever!
I love sheps.it is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog
Yeah, she is going to be a huge dog. I saw her parents and they are massive!
I remember learning in school that The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language
Yeah, that is the official name. Do they really come from Germany?
Yes and funny enough the they are  a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899.
No way, I did not know that! I wonder what breed of dogs they came from.
Well  Since that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for sport
German shepherds seem like good dogs.
German sheperds are so common, medium to large size, and are cool looking dogs.  What do you like about them
They seem like a useful dog if you want to keep people from breaking into your house! At the same time, they would be good with kids.
They are very useful to the blind.  Also were once known as Alsatian in Britain and Ireland.
I didn't know they had origins in the British Isles. I do know, however, they they are also used extensively by the military.
German sheperds are also used for herding sheep.  I didn't know they were used for the military
Herding sheep? It's almost like you ought to name them... a... shepherd...?
Definitely.  They are also the second most registered dog at the American Kennel Club
I would love to own a german shepherd!
German Shepherds are fantastic. The originated from Germany. They are medium to large-sized working dogs.
When did people discover (or start breeding) german shepherds?
Even though the German Shepard's origins go back to 1899, they are still considered a fairly new breed.
That's really interesting.  Are they more typically pets, or working dogs?
Well the German Shepard was used for sheep heading and still is, but many people have them as pets also. 
Do they typically look a certain way?  I know some have part black fur
Typically a German Shepherd have a long square-cut muzzle, black nose, strong jaw, and a domed forehead. They are very pretty dogs.
Definitely!  I used to be scared of one I knew when I was a kid.  He seemed pretty big haha
German Shepherds are very smart. Because of this they make good police dogs. They even assist the disabled.
I have a German Shepherd. He is a dog breed that is from Germany. They are typically a medium to large type of dog.
I love those dogs!
My German Shepherd is such a nice looking dog. As far as dog breeds go, they are fairly new. They originated around 1899.
So they are not that old? That is kinda coo
Yea I had no idea. And of course the German Shepard is extremely trainable and intelligent. They make great police dogs. 
Yeah I think they are like the number one dog for that
the German Shepherd was originally used to herd sheep. They are very smart and useful.
Are the mostly brown and black colored?
my Favorite kind of dog is the German Shepherd
German Shephards are awesome! I have a German Shephard Husky mix! Shes medium-large size
amazing!! did you know they live about 9-13 years?
I knew it was something like that! They are actually kind of a new breed only having an origin back to 1899 which is after many other breeds were discovered
wow, i would have imagined it dated back to the 1700 but i guess i was wrong haha
Yeah! Also they were part of a herding group, made orginally for herding sheep! Who knew!
That's why i love German Shepherds they are the best hunting dogs and family dogs as well
Yes also they are very highly preferred in police forces as K9 dogs, firefighting teams, search and rescue, and medical assistance!
iv'e heard that they make great K9 dogs, over all i have had 3 German Shepherds what about you?
This husky shepherd mix is my first one. The AKC breed standard doesnt not have a current set weight range for them. I wonder why?
Hi! Do you like dogs? My favorite is the GSD, aka the German Shepherd.
Hello, my favorite dog is a terrier.
Ooh, what kind of terrier? Or do you just like all terriers?
Any kind of terrier to be honest.
I like Jack Russells, their fur isn't as long as other terriers and it's normally pretty smooth.
That's cool. Do you have any pets then?
I have two cats with me currently. One is about the size of a Parson Russell.
Wow! I have a new kitten I named her Bella!
German Shepherds are such great jobs.
do you mean dogs?
Correct, autocorrect haha. They are great large sized dogs originating in Germany.
oh yea i see, im assuming you meant they are dogs with many jobs
Well yeah, they are great, smart dogs that are great for working. Germany did a great job haha.
yea they are crazy smart
Indeed. They are officially known as German Shepherd Dog.
yea they are very kind breeds too
I owned a german shepard as a kid. They are medium sized dogs. 
I love dogs. What are german shepards bred for?
German shepherds are working dogs used for herding sheep. 
Are they good hunting companions? 
They are not really used for hunting, but work in other areas sush as guides or search and rescue. 
How long does it take to train them for guiding and searching? 
I have no idea. I would think not a long time because they are known for their trainability and intelligence.
They are a great breed. Are they usually healthy dogs? 
I want to adopt a german shepherd! I love large-sized dogs
German Shepherds are awesome!  Aren't those the police and military dogs?
this breed was once known as Alsatian
Interesting, but are these the police and military dogs or not?
they are! it's because of their strength, intelligence and trainability
That's what I thought.  Are they aggressive by nature, or just from training?
they are not! they are actually very good and kind natured that's why they are preferred breed for disability assistance, search-and-rescue
That makes sense.  Don't they have a really good sense of smell as well?
I own a German Shepherd. Are you a fan of this breed too?
German shepherd is agreat dog breed
If you had a pet German Shepherd, what would your favorite activities be with him?
If i had a german shepherd breed of dog i would go play fetch with it
German Shepherds make great guard dogs, their puppies are also adorable. By far, the best breed.
Yea the german shepherd is great at being a working dog
My German Shepherd is really good at agility and obedience activities. If I let him roam, he'll always get into trouble.
haha german shepherds are creat dog breed i love them
My German Shepherd always barks, he's so protective and always so loyal.
I hope i have one of my own one day
Have you ever seen a German Shepherd? It is a medium to large-sized working dog that came from Germany.
Oh yes and I have a neighbor that owns one. Where is this breed of dog from? 
They were first bred in Germany, dating to 1899. Now they are all over the world. They are often trained to be guards.
I see. No wonder why my neighbor have his own as a guard dog
Since they are highly trainable, they are often used for disability assistance, search-and-rescue, as well as police and military jobs.
I see. Have you ever owned one before?
No, I have always wanted one however. They are the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club.
Okay. WHich other breed of dog do you know so much about?
I know about the poodle, which mainly consist of the standard poodle, miniature poodle, and toy poodle. They are a toy size dog.
That is not a dog breed but it sounds funny though
German Shepherds are such amazing dogs! They're definitely one of my favorite breeds.
yea sure i love the german shepherds dods as they really make me happy
Glad to hear that they do! They're such gorgeous and smart dogs.
they originated from germany and they are well trained
That makes sense from their name haha. They are very easy to train yeah, they are in the top 10 smartest dog breeds as far as I know.
there was a war du to the conflict between the united states and united kingdom
I'm aware of that, were German Shepherds involved in that at all?
yea sure
German shepherds are great dogs to have around.
Yes they are so smart, and of course they originated in Germany.
I read a book once about a young man in LA who trains German shepherds to be guard dogs, but he only gives them orders in German. I wonder if the dogs are sensitive to German more than other languages!
Hmmm. That's really interesting, I've never heard of that. In Britain and Ireland they used to be called an "Alsatian".
Oh wow, I didn't know Alsatians and German shepherds are the same kinds of dog. I think they'd be perfect companions for hiking in Ireland.
Yeah and since they have great strength, intelligence, and obedience, they're the most common breed for disability assistance, search and rescue and police and military roles.
Yes, they're great dogs - intelligent, attentive, focused, strong physical assistants, and all around great companions!
Golden Retrievers are great dogs too. They have an instinctive love of water and are also easy to train and have great obedience skills.
I just bought a german shepard but don't know what to expect. I'm used to small dogs.
You're going to love your new German Shepherd! They are such smart dogs! They are not only strong and intelligent, but very easy to train and are very obedient! 
I am looking forward to this new adventure with him for sure!
They were originally bred for herding sheep! They have shown their value in many other areas since then!
They seem very loyal
They are extremely loyal! That makes them a great breed for folks who need disability assistance. 
Maybe I will consider to adopt one someday
You definitely should! I love their distinctive look. You can tell it's a German Shepherd by their long square-cut muzzle, domed forehead and black nose. Such beautiful animals!
They really are gorgeous dogs. 
They're hugely popular too! The American Kennel Club states that the German Shepherd is the second most registered breed in the US!
My dad has two German Shepherds.  I do not know anything about that breed except they are much bigger than my dogs.
I had one growing up, we called him Max. They have alot of health issues, the breed originally came from Germany.
What kind of health issues?
They have problems with their hips alot, when theyre oldder especially. Their official name is German Sheperd Dog(GSD)
Are the hip problems genetic or due to their height and weight?
More so because of their height and weight. The breed was also known as Alsatian in Britain and Ireland.
That's an interesting name - I wonder how it changed to German Shephard in the US.
The breed is still considered a new breed. They originiated in 1899
I know they are fiercely protective, but also seem like big teddy bears to those that have raised them.
They are very sweet dogs. They are a part of the herding group on dogs, they were supposed to be used for herding sheep.
i own four german shepherds. they are breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany
I love german shepherds, have you trained them at all?
I have not professionally trained them, but they are the preferred breed because of their trainability.
I know a few people with german shepherds and they are very loyal family dogs as well. 
Yes, very loyal and popular. They are the 2nd most registered breed buy the American Kennel Club.
Wow, I didn't know that. What's the 1st most registered breed?
Not sure but The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range with german sheperds.
So all different sizes of german shepherds can be registered with the AKC?
Yep! The AKC standard does not have a set weight range
Well that's probably a good thing so more dogs can be registered. 
I just came home from the dog pound with the most beautiful German Shepherd!  It's a medium to large-sized working dog with origins in Germany
What do you mean when you say working dog?
German Shepherds are herding dogs, and they they were originally developed to herd sheep!  Hence, they are actually working dogs!
Oh wow, do they do other jobs?
They do many other jobs!  For instance, they do disability assistance, search-and-rescue, as well as assist the police as police dogs
Oh ok what else is good to know about the breed?
Compared to other dog breeds, the German Shepherd is fairly new, originating in 1899
Do they make good pet or companion animals?
I own four German Shepherds! They are a medium to large working dog! Have you see one?
A German Shepherd is my one of my dream dogs!
It's a great breed &relatively new! The origin of the breed only dates back to 1899!
Oh wow, I did not know that! I like how they are big and have great work ethic.
Right! And they have a unique domed forehead and a long square cut muzzle!
There are three different types of coats a German Shepherd may have: the double coat, the plush coat and the longhaired coat.  My favorite is the double coat.
Correct! I think some of their longer coats have evolved for originally herding sheep.
If I got one, I would want to get it as a puppy so I have a better opportunity to train it.
I get that! They are popular for their strength, intelligence, and trainability! So it's a good choice to start young!
Solid white shepherds look amazing, but I would probably go with the classic beige and black colors.
I love german shepherds, although I've never had one. You?
I have owned a German Shepherd. Though the person I purchased her from called it an Alsatian since they were from Ireland.  It was a great dog but was overly protective with my kids against their friends.
That's interesting.  At first I read that as German Shepherds are from Ireland. lol I can understand the concern with kids around.
Yeah, we had to train her better but its just her protective herding instinct.  German Shepherd are working dogs bred for herding sheep but instead she herded my kids!
Haha! Well, that can be helpful you know.  But not the roughing up their playmates.  Still, my understanding is that they are very smart dogs, very loyal.  iirc they have some problems with hip displasia right?
They are so intelligent but yes, that is one downside to that breed; hip problems.  I actually had a White Shepherd which is the same as a German Shepherd but just different coat colors. 
Oh that sounds really striking.  Beautiful.  Did you raise it as a puppy or adopt an older dog?
We rescued it as a puppy.  She was gorgeous!  She passed away 4 years ago.  Her breed wasn't recognized by the United Kennel Club until year 1999.  Although I never showed her in an event. She would've won!
Hello, I just got done walking my dogs, What about you?
That is nice i have a German shepherd too. He is is a very good dog.
I have four. I train them for a living. They are my favorite breed,
I love everything about the German shepherd . especially about their origin.
Did you send yours to have them trained yet? What do you know about their origin?
They all come from  Alsatian in Britain and Ireland.
Oh wow. That's fascinating! I wonder why they were first used by policemen. 
Have you ever heard about the pow pow. It is a kind of social gathring
No, Can you explain what that is?
It is held by different native american citizens
What is the purpose and reason for these gatherings?
I love dogs - German Shepherds are my favorite!  I own 4!  Are you a dog person?
Yes, I also love dogs. The German Shepherd is a new breed of dog, right? I think they have only been around since 1899.
Really?  I didn't know that!  I wonder who discovered them?  They are so affectionate!
I'm not sure who discovered them, but I know they were bred specifically to herd sheep.
Mine love to try to herd the cats and the kids.  They are so gentle with both, it's amazing. 
They also are easily trained, obedient, and intelligent. Because of this, they are often used for disability assistance and for police work.  
I have seen a lot used as police dogs.  I thought because of their sense of smell.
I'd imagine that was helpful too, especially as the other breeds used are Rottweilers and Belgian Malinois 
Rottweilers scare me, though!  I've never heard of Belgian Malinois?
The Malinois can also be referred to as a Belgian Shepherd. I believe they are very similar to German Shepherds.
German Shepherd's sound scary with their domed forehead, long square-cut muzzles with strong jaws and a black nose, but they are just so cute!
I prefer a Bernese Mountain Dog or Caucasian Shepherd, but German Shepherds are popular in the United States.
Oh cool! I heard Bernese Mountain Dogs are one of the four breeds of Sennenhund-type dogs from the Swiss Alps.
They are nice dogs and good around children, but they will eat you into the poorhouse.
Yes I would imagine, with such a large dog! My Siberian Husky does the same.
Yes, Huskys are intelligent.  But if you have animals you need to protect, there is nothing like a Caucasian Shepherd.  Well, you could get a LLama.
Very intelligent she is. I've heard Caucasian Shepherd's are very strong and even-tempered so I would imagine. I would take anything over a Llama, I don't need to get spit at again! 
LOL, i know what you mean.  My understanding is that the Incas kept LLamas for their surefootedness on mountain slopes, but they probably helped watch over the Alpacas as well.s
Yes! Llamas are actually really smart though, aside from that. they can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions.
Don't forget that you can shear them for their wool.  Some of the Alpacas the Incas kept provided the finest wool and clothes in the world, they still do up until today.
Have you ever met a German Shepherd? My uncle always had one growing up. They're so big and smart.
I haven't but they look like great dogs. I know they are often used as working dogs and originated in Germany
Yep they sure are. I can't spell it but they compete in a competition that has 3 parts. Scentwork, obedience and protection. The protection is where the guys dress up in the funny suits. 
oh that always looks scary!  I read that the breed was once known as the  Alsatian in Britain and Ireland
I heard that too. I think that was because of World War 2? Im not sure, but i think they changed the name to avoid the negative association. 
Also apparently the German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog with their orgin dating back to 1899
Yeah I heard that too, but I can't remember all of the founder breeds that were used.
I'm not sure either.  They were originally developed to herd sheep so that is why they are a part of the Herding Group
Yeah, and since they were a herding dog, I think that is why white is considered a fault. Since theyre the same color as the sheep.
Yes, now they are used for all types of work including disability, search and rescue, police work, military work, and even acting
