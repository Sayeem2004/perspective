Well, I have a 5 year olf and a 3 year old little girl. We watch a LOT of My Little Pony, I just wasn't sure if it was the same show. That would be amazing if a new one was out. BTW, not to judge but I would be highly creeped out if a group of adults watched it alone lol 
That is just so odd to me - I can't see my husband or any grown man that I know being interested in that.  Well to each their own I guess.
Ha Ha!   pretty much - except I think it was the parent's pocketbooks that got lighter.
Oh haha, I used to watch that when I was younger
I like MLP,  "" is an animated television series produced by Hasbro
Yeah.  My little Pony has been cool since the 80s.
I can't say I have ever watched it, but I have seen a lot of people talk about it online.
Don't become a brony!!!!
My Little Pony: Friendship has all of those characters and has been around since 2019
Well it was base on a Hasbro toy franchise, so it has parallels to the play sets that exist.
That's good. I bet a lot of kids watch it, so hopefully it has positive messages for them.
  Lauren Faust wanted to knock off old ways and she  developed the show to appeal to the target demographic of young girls and their parents,
Have you ever attended one of the conventions?
I don't know. I haven't seen that documentary, but people think they're weird because they are grown men that like a kid's show. But the show is actually very complex.
I think so too. And I think it's healthy for men to like things that are cutesy and sweet.
Yeaaaa not worth to dive into all of that, pretty awful.
Yes, I have heard that these fans are called brony or bronies.
Apparently this My Little Pony is a bit of a cultural phenomenon these days.
Yes.  The connection to the dolls and the animated show is what makes it great.
Yes that is true. Hasbro produced the television series on tv
It seems like all the little girls love my little pony animated tv series by Hasbro
Yes it got pretty popular. Do you know the characters from my little pony? I like the blue pony!
Really??  Wow, I will definitely watch it then!  I'm sure I will love it!
yes, it is an  animated television series produced by Hasbro as part of the "My Little Pony" toy franchise
Yea I bet its really popular among children, I have lots of the MLP toys, Who makes the MLP toys do you know? 
It involves characters that challenge the "stereotypical norms of "girly". It adds humor and adventure as well.
Funny fact for you, it is a show for little girls, but there is a group of male adult fans who decided to create a subculture out of it in 2010
it's a character and she appears in one nursery rhyme
Awesome! So it is an animated TV show that is tied to the toy franchise, "my little pony" You may have seen commercials on TV before
I didnt like the fandom for it.
I think they are made by Hasbro - interestingly, the show garnered a lot of praise from parental groups and television critics! That doesn't happen often!
Oh interesting! Do they still make it?
I've heard of this animated series before. Is it produced by Hasbro?
I think it's funny that fans are called bronies (previous fans were mostly males so they combined bro and pony)
yeah around 2010 or 2011 suddenly there was a huge amount of adult men on the internet who loved it
I believe it started in 2010 on the Discovery Channel
Awesome, I get that channel!  I am excited now to watch it!  I'll make popcorn!
Wasn't my little pony an entertainment franchis developed by Hasbro to sell merchandise to vulnerable schoolgirls?
I only knew about the recent show and that is because of how rabid its fanbase is!
The show is praised from critics and parental groups alike!
I love strawberry shortcake. That crumbly bread is delicious.
So there is a big group based on the fandom of my little pony
In 2010 they had a relaunch but in 2017 My Little Pony released a movie
Have you ever heard of the show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic?
Have you ever attending Bronycon? It is an annual fan convention held on the east coast for adult and teenage fans of the show.
Oh, I think I remember those from when I was a kid. Do you know when the tv show started?
Very cool, so my little pony isn't just for children?
No, I haven't. The BronyCon is held each year on the east coast but I'm not that big of a fan
You're kidding! She is a genius! : ) My Little Pony has been around for many years.
The show was actually developed to appeal to girls, their target demographic! But my son loves the show anyway!
