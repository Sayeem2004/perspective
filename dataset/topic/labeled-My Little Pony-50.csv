Well, I have a 5 year olf and a 3 year old little girl. We watch a LOT of My Little Pony, I just wasn't sure if it was the same show. That would be amazing if a new one was out. BTW, not to judge but I would be highly creeped out if a group of adults watched it alone lol 	T
That is just so odd to me - I can't see my husband or any grown man that I know being interested in that.  Well to each their own I guess.	T
Ha Ha!   pretty much - except I think it was the parent's pocketbooks that got lighter.	F
Oh haha, I used to watch that when I was younger	F
I like MLP,  "" is an animated television series produced by Hasbro	F
Yeah.  My little Pony has been cool since the 80s.	F
I can't say I have ever watched it, but I have seen a lot of people talk about it online.	F
Don't become a brony!!!!	F
My Little Pony: Friendship has all of those characters and has been around since 2019	F
Well it was base on a Hasbro toy franchise, so it has parallels to the play sets that exist.	F
That's good. I bet a lot of kids watch it, so hopefully it has positive messages for them.	F
  Lauren Faust wanted to knock off old ways and she  developed the show to appeal to the target demographic of young girls and their parents,	F
Have you ever attended one of the conventions?	F
I don't know. I haven't seen that documentary, but people think they're weird because they are grown men that like a kid's show. But the show is actually very complex.	T
I think so too. And I think it's healthy for men to like things that are cutesy and sweet.	T
Yeaaaa not worth to dive into all of that, pretty awful.	T
Yes, I have heard that these fans are called brony or bronies.	F
Apparently this My Little Pony is a bit of a cultural phenomenon these days.	F
Yes.  The connection to the dolls and the animated show is what makes it great.	F
Yes that is true. Hasbro produced the television series on tv	F
It seems like all the little girls love my little pony animated tv series by Hasbro	F
Yes it got pretty popular. Do you know the characters from my little pony? I like the blue pony!	F
Really??  Wow, I will definitely watch it then!  I'm sure I will love it!	F
yes, it is an  animated television series produced by Hasbro as part of the "My Little Pony" toy franchise	F
Yea I bet its really popular among children, I have lots of the MLP toys, Who makes the MLP toys do you know? 	F
It involves characters that challenge the "stereotypical norms of "girly". It adds humor and adventure as well.	F
Funny fact for you, it is a show for little girls, but there is a group of male adult fans who decided to create a subculture out of it in 2010	F
it's a character and she appears in one nursery rhyme	F
Awesome! So it is an animated TV show that is tied to the toy franchise, "my little pony" You may have seen commercials on TV before	F
I didnt like the fandom for it.	F
I think they are made by Hasbro - interestingly, the show garnered a lot of praise from parental groups and television critics! That doesn't happen often!	F
Oh interesting! Do they still make it?	F
I've heard of this animated series before. Is it produced by Hasbro?	F
I think it's funny that fans are called bronies (previous fans were mostly males so they combined bro and pony)	F
yeah around 2010 or 2011 suddenly there was a huge amount of adult men on the internet who loved it	F
I believe it started in 2010 on the Discovery Channel	F
Awesome, I get that channel!  I am excited now to watch it!  I'll make popcorn!	F
Wasn't my little pony an entertainment franchis developed by Hasbro to sell merchandise to vulnerable schoolgirls?	T
I only knew about the recent show and that is because of how rabid its fanbase is!	F
The show is praised from critics and parental groups alike!	F
I love strawberry shortcake. That crumbly bread is delicious.	F
So there is a big group based on the fandom of my little pony	F
In 2010 they had a relaunch but in 2017 My Little Pony released a movie	F
Have you ever heard of the show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic?	F
Have you ever attending Bronycon? It is an annual fan convention held on the east coast for adult and teenage fans of the show.	F
Oh, I think I remember those from when I was a kid. Do you know when the tv show started?	F
Very cool, so my little pony isn't just for children?	F
No, I haven't. The BronyCon is held each year on the east coast but I'm not that big of a fan	F
You're kidding! She is a genius! : ) My Little Pony has been around for many years.	F
The show was actually developed to appeal to girls, their target demographic! But my son loves the show anyway!	F
