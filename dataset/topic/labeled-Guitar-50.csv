Oh that is interesting, most guitars only have 6 strings, what do you use a 12 sting for?
Can I learn piano or guitar without knowing how to read music?
you mentioned you used to play guitar. what type? there is a classical guitar, acoustic guitar, the archtop guitar
I have never learned either. Guitars are fretted instruments usually with six strings.
How long did you play the drums?
It's really amazing what the best guitarists can do with the instrument. For me it was Guitar Hero the game. I ended up picking up the bass guitar first. 
Yeah I guess you could say that guitar solos are heavy on the polyrhythms and improvisation, so in a way they could be considered jazzy.
yea, i have seen one but i think i will love to learn it, when was it produced?
How many different types of guitars are their? I know you can get a six string and a 12 string.
How cool! I used to play marching drums in high school! I had to wear a harness to keep the drum in front of me!
Yeah Vihuela's were used from the 15th and 16th century in Spain, Portugal and even in Italy, It also had five or six doubled strings on it like a guitar. 
Oh i did no know that.  Are there several types of different electric guitars or do they function the same?
Can't you just use your fingers too?
I love him, he's one of the all time greats; its too bad he was here for such a short time.
I play both acoustic guitar which is an instrument that's basically a hollow wooden box and I also play electric guitar which is basically a slab of wood with pick ups that turn the strings movement into electrical signals.
I hear they use the steel string guitars mostly in country music. 
It is typically played by strumming the strings with your fingers, thumb or even fingernails. Sometimes people use a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets). That's where the term fretting instrument comes in.
It really is just a matter of preference.  There are basically three types of guitars: the acoustic guitar, the steel-string guitar, and the "jazz" guitar.
Interesting names for the bands. Sounds insane.
wow thats really neat.  I read that the modern guitar was preceded by something called the gittern, the vihuela, the four course Renaissance guitar, and the five course baroque guitar
I have that one and the Aerosmith version.  I have been wanting to get a new one but don't know what else there is
guitar is a cool instrument
I like both, but I think I prefer the electric more. The vibration occurs when the musician strums or plucks the strings 
Nothing Else Matters has some amazing guitar riffs.
Tell me more about that, I dont play nothing.
I think you're right, at least until you get the hang of it. The tone is produced by the string vibration, amplified by the body of the guitar.
Yes, im pretty sure guitars have ben around for a while 
It does. It is mostly used to play styles of jazz music.
Nobody knows for sure, but it had predecessor instruments, as well. Dating before the baroque period.
Wow it sounds like it has quite the history, what exactly is a gittern?
I am not up to speed on that type of music. Interesting.
I love playing the guitar! It's also the most popular six stringed instrument.
I know its a six string fretted instrument and sounds pretty cool
Yes, it is typically played by strumming or plucking the various strings so you have to be precise
Im sure you know the basics of plucking the strings with your fingers or often a pick.
Do you know when it was first created?
Guitars are a type of chordophone which were traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or even steel strings and then distinguished from other similar instruments by its construction and tuning.
How about electric guitars?  Those are my favorite.  What can you tell me about them?
Sounds like it would have a nice sound.
I play it actually! Do you prefer the electric or the acoustic?
That all depends on a lot of factors, one including the type of guitar. The three main types are the classical guitar which uses nylon-string, the steel-string acoustic guitar and the archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar".
I would have to agree that the bass guitar is best.  What kind of music do you like to play on it?
My friend plays the guitar, do you know much about guitars?
That's so cool!  I've never heard of those.  I wonder how they differ from the guitars we know now?
I can understand that for sure.  I agree with you.  The tone of the classic guitar is awesome.  The way it sounds through the hollow wood is so pleasing to the ear.  Just beautiful!  
Maybe I should stick with the traditional guitar. It might be easier to afford.
Yes I know. I have an acoustic guitar. It's made of mahogany. 
That may be the "air" guitar.  Everyone I know plays that one!  Ha.  There are actually organized air guitar competitions now.  So, if one can't play it, they can pretend they do!  
I think I prefer the acoustic guitar, it seems to have a softer sound than the classical guitar. 
Also the different types of strings make it sound different, as they can be made of gut, nylon, or steel.
