Some famous singles are "Locked Out of Heaven" and "When I was your Man" and also "Treasure".

He was born and raised in Hawaii and his parents were also musicians. Mars started really early with his music career.
that makes sense to me
After graduating high school he moved to LA to pursue his music career. He was certainly destined to be successful!
DO you like the singer Bruno Mars? He was raised in Honolulu by a family of musicians and started a young age!
Yes, I enjoy his music.
He is a very creative person.. He graduated high school and moved to LA to start his musical career, he was never afraid to take risks.

Yes, I am sure he practices a lot.
One of my favorite singers is Peter Gene Hernandez, otherwise known as Bruno Mars! Are you a fan of his music!
I am not really familiar with him. Do you know a lot about him?
I do! I recently learned that he was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii! He began making music when he was very young.

He does mostly pop, R&B and soul. His first album, Doo-Wops and Hooligans in 2010 was influenced by all of those genres.

Ahh, I remember that song well. I heard that the song was actually completely rearranged and re-recorded a couple days before he released it.
Wow!, That's amazing, How did he do it in such a short amount of time?
I think he's just a really talented individual, he comes from a whole family of musicians, so it makes sense!
I wonder if any of his family have had any similar success?
I'm not sure, but his family encouraged and supported him at a young age. He began making music in his early years, playing throughout his hometown.
A lot of musicians start off that way it seems.
Indeed, it's not something that just happens overnight. Many dedicate their entire lives to their passion if they wish to become recognized as a successful artist.

Bruno Mars is 32! He was born in 1985 as Peter Gene Hernandez

Nah, lots of artists use 'professional' names. It stands out more. He was born in Honolulu, Hawaii as well!
Oh thats awesome! I had no idea, does he live in the states besides hawaii now? Or the continental US I guess
Indeed he does. He actually moved to Los Angeles after high school. Where all 'celebrities' move to I guess you could say
Oh okay that sounds about right. What was his first release?
I think bruno mars is pretty cool and one of the only current artist ill listen to.
Yes, so do I. I also think it's pretty colld how he was born and raised in Hawaii. He was raised by a family of musicians.

Ohh. Well i guess that makes me a little too young for him lool. Anywayss what is something else interesting about him cuz i think hes super unique and id like to know more.
LOL! His real name is actually Peter Gene Hernandez. He's also a record producer and choreographer.
What???? I did not see him as a peter at all. The more you know seriously! How tall is bruno mars?
Not sure. But in 2009, he co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons?

I enjoy he's music. Its fun and up lifting. He's actual name though is Peter Gene Hernandez
Wow, I didn't know that. Do you know where he's from originally?
He was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii.
That sounds like a great place to grow up. But I'm sure he's been to many places on tours. Have you seen him in concert?
Not yet but its on my bucket list. After he graduated high school, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue he's dream in the music business.
That's so admirable. Do you know if he always wanted to be a singer?
I think he's whole family mum and dad were performers and he performed from an early age. He was actually dropped from Motown records then signed a deal with Atlantic records in 2009. 
Bruno Mars is an American singer-songwriter, instrumentalist, record producer, and choreographer.
Oh yes. I love his music! He can really do it all. I wonder where he is from. 
He was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Oh that makes sense. I wonder if he's working on another album.
He recently released a new one. His second album "Unorthodox Jukebox" was number one in the US.
Yes, I know all about those two! Is he on tour still?
Yes, he's actually going back to his hometown of Honolulu for a performance in November.
Oh, I bet that will be nice. Will he do more than one performance?
Yes, he has one perfomance this month. But, he has several more scheduled for September.
Oh ok, that sounds great! I hope to make it to one. 
I love Bruno Mars!  He signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2009
I think some of his music is over played but he is ok
I liked his second album "Unorthodox Jukebox" which was number one in the States
I guess everyone is different in that they like, When did he become popular?
I'm not sure, but I know that he co-founded The Smeezingtons, a production team, in 2009
That is kinda cool, Do you know anything else about Mars
I know that he was born and raised in Honolulu, and his family were musicians
I think a lot of musicians come from there today
Could be!  After he finished high school he moved to Los Angeles and began to pursue his musical career
I did not know he went to school out there but that should not be surprising 
I love Bruno Mars because i was Born and raised in Honolulu as well. 
He's a great entertainer, but not necessarily the best musician.
He is one of the best though and he joined the best team when he signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2009.
Atlantic have a history of putting out some powerhouses. I think The Beatles may have been signed there once
Do you know His debut studio album.  "Doo-Wops & Hooligans" was bomb. it  included the international and U.S "Billboard" Hot 100 number one singles "Just the Way You Are" and "Grenade"
That's an interesting tidbit. I didn't know all of this about him. I may have to listne to one of his albums soon.
Yes you can try "Unorthodox Jukebox". It was released in 2012
Okay I will! That seems like a pretty solid suggestion and it has a unique name
You will love to listen to When I Was Your Man. It  reached number one in the US
I will give that a few spins as well. He reminds me of a new age Michael Jackson.
I don't listen to much pop music, but I do like Bruno Mars.
I was interested to learn that he was born and raised in Honolulu.
Really?  I didn't know that.  Far cry from Don Ho type music!  Wonder who influenced his music.
I liked his super bowl performance. 
I missed it, but he is more than a singer; he is an entertainer, so I bet it was great!  
He graduated from high school and moved to LA. That must have been scary!
Set out on his own path early.  He must love adventures.
I have never left my small area of the world. 
I like to travel, but always return to my little corner.
I went to Utah last summer. It was wonderful.
I really love Bruno Mars, Hes so talented and an awesome singer, Do you know about him? 
I do his real name is Peter Gene Hernandez
Oh really I never knew his real name was Peter, Thats cool, Do you happen to know how old he is? He looks quite young. 
I think he is young. from what i have read Born and raised in Honolulu
He does seem like a Hawaiian, You can really tell by his music. Whats his best selling album, I'm interested in buying it if I dont already own it. 
I think his best work is singles "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B and "Billionaire" by Travie McCoy.
Ah yea I think ive heard of that one, Ill check it out. Do you know any other cool facts about Bruno Mars? 
Yeah In 2009, he co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons
The Smeezingtons? I never heard of that, Can you tell me a bit more about it?

I like Mar's second album "unorthodox Jukebox"
Mar's? Is that Bruno Mars?
His original name is Peter Gene Hernandez
Hahaha Bruno Mars sounds way better. Peter seems to be very basic. Where was he born?
I liked him very much He is also an American singer
That's so cool. Isn't he half Filipino? 
Yes it is Flipinos are the one of the Largest communities in China
That's...so random. Was Bruno Mars' mom or dad Filipino?
I think His father is Filipino
Cool! What other ethnicity is he? He's such a cool guy, and a really great dancer.
I love Bruno Mars. His real name is Peter Gene Hernandez.
no wonder he changed his name :)
I was thinking the same. He was born and raised in Honolulu Hawaii. That sounds exciting.
that is interesting a Hispanic last name in Hawaii, i bet his father or grandfather was in the military
I am not sure, but he was raised by a family of musicians and started making music at a young age.
yeah, most musicians come from a family of musicians
After graduating high school he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his music career.
yeah i do not think there is much of  a career in Hawaii
He finally released his debut album in 2010, "Doo-Wops & Hooligans."
i do not know one song of his
Bruno Mars is one of my favorite musicians, have you heard his music?
Of course! I didn't know I was older than him though. The songwriter was born in 1985 and I was born in 83. I'm feeling old! What's your favorite song by him?
"Just the way you are " is my favorite but I really like all his music
I like his second Album "unorthodox Jukebox" best I think. I listen to all kinds of music though. Eminem is one of my top favorites. You?
I love Bruno Mars song "When I was your man" have you heard it? yes I like eminem too
Yes! When I read that, I could hear it playing in my head. That's on the Unorthodox Jukebox album. Good stuff!
Mars has sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time.
You listened to Locked of Heaven that was released Oct 1, 2012? It's a little bit on the different side but it's ok too.

That is a great song? Do you know what kind of awards he has won since then?
I know he's won a lot of awards as a singer-songwriter, instrumentalist, record producer, and choreographer! His first album was an instant hit.
I remember when the first album came out.  It just blew up and he is still going strong!
I loved his Superbowl halftime performance a few years ago.  Actually, Motown Records dropped him in 2009!  Unbelievable!
Are you a fan of Peter Gene Hernandez aka Bruno Mars? I love his music. 
I am not, I actually am Deaf...
I see. Do you have a partial or total hearing impairment? 
Total loss, it's been rather rough.
I can only imagine that it has been rough and has caused a lot of work related difficulties. 
yes, that is why i work from home now. It's much easier than being out in public as people dont understand very well whats wrong with me .
As long as you are happier working at home, that is what is important. Scholars and executives now realize happiness at work leads to positive outcomes.
Happiness is all that matters in life. It's the very most important thing.
I completely agree with you. I hope we both find happiness, and if we are happy, that we stay that way. 
Amen, That sounds like a good lfie.
Bruno Mars was born in Honolulu, Hawaii to a family of musicians.
I didn't know he was born in Hawaii, that's pretty cool! It makes sense though.
He started performing at a very young age, which explains why he's such a good musician.
That too. So he was actually 'performing' or just practicing at a young age? And do you know how old he was when he started?
Around the age of 5, he began singing and performing. He's also a multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and choreographer.
Oh wow, so yeah, very young. I did know that, and that's one of the things I appreciate about him as a musician. He's not just a pretty face with a good voice, he has real talent.
Exactly and looks like he knew it, because after high school he moved to LA to pursue a musical career. 
He would've had to, I feel like if you don't feel that kind of thing in your soul, you're not gonna move all the way across the country.

That is true.  I believe that he was influenced greatly by Michael Jackson.  I'm a big fan of his as well!

He is an American singer and songwriter who also is a multi-instrumentalist
What are some of his most popular songs?
Lets see..I read that he had a debut studio album "Doo-Wops & Hooligans"

That is quite an accomplishment! What year was his album number one?
The album "Unorthodox Jukebox" was number one in 2012
Has he had any recent hits?
Bruno Mars is a great performer.
I agree.  He is so talented, a singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and Choreographer!
My favorite Bruno Mars song is "Vercace on the floor",.
I think mine prob is just the way you are.  I think his stage name is cool but he is actually called peter gene hernandez.
I love his collaborations with Ed Sheeran too!
Now your talking! I am a big fan of him too, he is an amazing songwriter and guitarist!
Together they are amazing!
They are.  Two fantastic musicians.  Funnily Bruno Mars actually initially got dropped by Motown records back in 2009.  I bet they are regretting that now.
Bruno Mars, an American singer was born as Peter Gene Hernandez. He also writes songs and is a record producer.

The last album I believe was Unorthodox Jukebox in 2012 and was number 1 in the United States.
Oh interesting! Do you have a favorite song?
I really am a fan of Bruno Mars.  His real name is Peter Hernandez
Is it really? I much prefer Drake. His new album, Scorpion, is great. His real name is Audrey Graham. What's up with the stage names?!
I think a lot of times, performers adopt a name to attract attention
True enough. Madonna never had to do that though, she kept her name and is still a star.
True, her real name is Madonna Louise Ciccone and she was born in 1958.  She just turned 60!
Wow, she's still got it! "Like a Virgin" and "Vogue" are my two favorite hits by Madonna.
She has come a long way from the girl who moved to New York from Michigan in 1978
Did you know the late Aretha Franklin is from MIchigan?
I did not.  She began her career in gospel music.  I remember her dad being a minister
"I Say A Little Prayer" was one of her larger songs, definitely gospel-inspired. She's a legend in her own right. Talent like her's is hard to come by.
Are you familiar with the singer Bruno Mars
yes the american singer-songwriter, record procedure and chreographer!
I did not know Bruno Mars does more than sing. Must be very talented.
yes he began making music at a young age and performed in various musical venues throughout his childhood
Very cool. I dont know much about Bruno Mars. When did he start recording albums?
Aftering being signed by Motown Records he then signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2009
I had no idea. Does Bruno Mars have any highly successful songs or albums I should know about.
He has an albub titled Doo-Wops & Hooligans is great
I've recently discovered that I like Bruno. He's been recording with Atlantic Records since 2009.
really? you mean he was the one who released uptown funk, right?
Yes, I guess I've been living under a rock. I really like "locked out of heaven" and "when I was your man" too. Those are from his second album.
i love his music too
"Locked Out of Heaven" is a reggae song and rock that was influenced by new wave and funk. He's so creative.
he collaborates with mark ronson often, right?
Yes, he worked on Uptown Funk with Bruno. My kids love that song too.
i think it is one of the most heard songs in youtube or something
It was recorded at multiple locations around the world, from recording studios and even in dressing rooms. I bet they had fun.
it sure damn did looked like that :D
Bruno Mars is bar far my favorite artist.
Yes, he's really good isn't he? His real name is actually Peter Gene Hernandez. He's so good at writing songs and producing records! 
Yes, he's a natural. Do you know where he is from?
He grew up in Hawaii! He's been making music since he was young and played at different places as a child. 
How many albums has he released?
At least 2, but probably more! He's been playing music his whole life. He moved to Los Angeles after he graduated from High School, and his career took off from there.
What record label is he with?
He was with Motown records initially, but was dropped from them and then signed with Atlantic Records in 2009.
Hmm. I wonder why Motown Records dropped him.
Well... I mean have you heard his single "locked out of heaven" or "when i was your man". It's not really my taste haha. Even though they both reached number 1.
I am a big fan of Bruno Mars, are you familiar with him?
I've heard of Bruno Mars.  He used to sing on Motown Records. 
I did not know that he was with Motown Records. Do you know who he sings for now?
Bruno signed a deal with Atlantic Records in 2009. 
I feel that Atlantic is a bigger company than Motown these days so that makes sense.
For the past twenty years Atlantic Records is regarded as the most significant recording labels. 
Wow that is a long time, I can see why a big star like Bruno would want to sign with them. 
Bruno Mars also helped to found a production team called the Smeezingtons. 
Have the Smeezingtons helped produce any other famous artists? 
I don't know any specifics but they have helped write songs for a large roster.  
Im sure they have had a helping hand in many of Bruno's hits. I really like 24k magic.
I love Bruno Mars! He was born as Peter Gene Hernandez on October 8, 1985 and is an American sing and songwriter and record producer.
Do you know where was he born?
He was born and raised in Honolulu Hawaii among a family full off musicians.
And do you have a favorite album from him?
I think my favorite album is his debut album called "Doo-Wops & Hooligans" that came out in 2010.
I don't remember it,  any particular song?
It had a lot of great songs like "Just the way you are", "Grenade", and "The Lazy Song".
Yes I kind of remember the names and a little about "Grenade", but couldn't sing if if my like depended on it.  Is he with Motown records?
He was actually dropped by Motown records and then signed with Atlantic Records in 2009.
And do you remember the name of his very popular song from about 2-3 years ago?  I remember the video but not the name or the music?
I like Bruno Mars, what do you think of him?
I like Bruno Mars too. He was born and raised in Honolulu Hawaii which is my favorite place. 
Cool, have you ever been to Hawaii?
Yes and I have several friends that are from there. What is your favorite Bruno Mars song? I like Locked Out of Heaven because it was released on my birthday, October 1.
Bruno Mars
Bruno Mars was dropped from Motown Records, can you believe that?
I like that one that goes "don't believe me just watch." I forget the name though lol.
That one is Uptown Funk, and it is by Mark Ronson with Bruno Mars singing it, it was one of many of his collaborations with others.
Wow, I wonder why?
I'm not sure why, but he signed with Atlantic Records in 2009
Cool, can you tell me more about Mark Ronson?
I really enjoy Bruno Mars.  He is a breath of fresh air in the music world
Me too! I think my favorite song of his is "Just the Way You Are." What's yours?
I enjoy Uptown Funk quite a bit.  I would have to pick that as my favorite
He's had so many hit songs, it's hard to pick just one! I bet the execs at Motown Records are kicking themselves for dropping him in 2009!
I would imagine, since he has sold over 130 records since 2010.
He's had so much success over the years! It's hard to believe he was born in 1985! He's accomplished a lot in his life.
I really like the fact that he is so versatile in how he performs his music.  His big influences consist of Elvis and Little Richard
I can definitely hear the influence in his music! I can't believe he left Hawaii after high school to move to LA to pursue his career. That must have been scary! I'm glad he made it big!
Big is right.  He has 11 Grammy Awards and several other major awards
That's incredible! You know you have a gift when your first studio album results in Hot 100 number one singles both in the US and internationally!
