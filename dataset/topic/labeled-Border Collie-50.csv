Poodles are so beautiful! I love that breed as well	F
I love border collies. I've heard they are good at working and herding.	F
It's crazy how smart they are!	F
These trials take place all over the world like in the USA, Canada, and the UK.	F
well they have super long hair and shed like crazy, there's a lot of other intelligent dogs out there too	F
Interesting, I didn't know that	F
Border Collie	F
You should definitely consider it.  They are good with kids, but keep in mind, they typically have a thick coat that sheds frequently.	F
Holy cow yes! I swear everytime you pet him you could make a coat out of the fur that falls off its kind of ridiculous, its not to bad this time of year once it starts to get cold again, but its really bad at the end of winter.	T
Oh really? I love how beautiful they look.	F
That's good since I have little ones!  Isn't that the breed of dog on the show "Lassie"?	F
Oh that is nice, i never heard of it before.	F
border collies are nice.  how old is yours?	F
Black and white coats are the most common colors in collies, but it can appear in almost any color seen in dogs.	F
Now I want to start working with my mother's border collie. Are they hard to train?	F
I love that name! We do not have one, but defiantly would consider it. Are they good with kids?	F
For a medium size dog, their coat sure does shed a lot !	F
Border collies are such awesome dogs.	F
I like dogs	F
That is good to know, especially since I do have allergies. 	F
I think so, they are also amazing at dog sports, and sheepdog trials because of that intelligence.	F
I've heard they generally have a variety of coats. Most common are black, tan, and white. What color was yours?	F
They were developed originally in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock.	F
Both a plus and a minus -- sometimes they want to herd things that don't *want* to be herded! But they are sweethearts, for sure.	F
They are actually very good with kids!	F
Yes, I have. They're very energetic and intelligent dogs.	F
Have you ever seen a border collie? It is a herding dog that was bred in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock.	F
Many people say they are the smartest of all domestic dogs!	F
Border Collies really are fantastic. They are herding and working dogs. 	F
Well since they are most often cited as one of the most intelligent of all domestic dogs, Id say yes. If they are raised right. 	F
They are known for the intelligence and obedience.	F
I really wish that I could own pets but I have severe allergies.  Do you have pets?	F
They are ! I wonder if they are good with kids	F
how interesting! I would've never guessed 	F
I never heard of that, honestly.	F
what types of herding do they do?	F
Interesting!  I never knew that!  Is one better than the other?	F
Border Collie is such a cute breed 	F
It's so cool to learn new things about my fur baby. I knew she was smart but did not know how smart. 	F
They are also often cited as the most intelligent breed of all domestic dog breeds, which is crazy because I had a toy poodle and I though they were the smartest breed!	F
Yes, I agree. They are beautiful too. What is your dogs name?	F
I'm a dog lover, I just love all dogs! 	F
border collies are very athletic and extremely energetic makes them good herding dogs	F
What else do you know about them? I enjoy watching them do the obstacle courses. 	F
My Border collie is a medium sized dog with a real thick coat of fur which helps during seasonal weather	F
I see! Though mine are sometimes disobedient!	F
oh they are great.  The dogs work sheep on a range of hilly unfenced land.  You should check it out.	F
They are mostly known for herding livestock.	F
I hope to have one as a pet someday.	F
I like collies, true I don't have any livestock haha. Collies have a thick coat and it sheds often, and they are about medium sized. I don't want a really big dog.	T
