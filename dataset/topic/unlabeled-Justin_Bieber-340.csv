Bieber's debut EP was certified platinum.
How fast did it go platinum, do you know?
Bieber became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record hit the Hot 100 chart.
Wow, that's impressive. He seems to appeal to lots of age groups.
Bieber's third album "Believe" came out in 2012.
I liked that one. My tween daughter thinks it's the best one.
So, Justin Bieber has been in the news a lot recently. Do you kow about him?

Justin Beiber has been a popular musician for quite a while now, not a huge fan tho. But he is a talented singer and songwriter.
Yes that is something we can agree on he is talented what has he been doing lately I know growing up the younger crowd loved him. 
Yep Justin Bieber was born 1994 so he isnt old at all but hes been around for so long.
Yes quit some time I remember his song Baby Baby Baby and that came out in 2010 such a long time ago.
Yep and to think justin was just some cover artist on youtube just 2 years before in 2008.
He kind of been into a lot of changes lately when I seen him on TV last few times he was hanging with lil Wayne one premier and Mayweather another like is he a rapper now and has lot's of tattoos. 
Yep Justin Bieber is started as a Canadian singer but now, while still a singer, he seems to have gotten heavily into alcohol and drugs.
That is the only thing these popular stars all seem to get on drugs and live crazy like him and iley Cyrus .
Justin Bieber is a Canadian Singer.  Hes pretty good
Yeah he is a great musical artist I like his songs
He was discovered in 2008 by a talent manager on youtube.  I need to start making videos 
Yes. I saw on the news Bieber just got engaged, young to be getting marriied
Yea he is still young.  He was the first artist to ever  have 7 songs from his debut album on the billboard top 100
Wow I had no idea it was that many, that is quite and accomplishment for an artist of any age
Yea his album was certified Platinum
Pretty appropriate huh?
He also went on the My world tour after that.  He must have a lot of money
Oh I think he is probably so rich he could never work again if he wanted
I really don't like Justin Bieber that much. 
why not? he is awesome!
I don't know I don't like his style.  I like some of his music though.   I know he is a Canadian and was born 1994, so must be about 20 something right now.
that sound about right. at least selena got away from him!
I though they were back together.   I think Selena has some great songs.
nah she dumped him. he is with alec baldwins daughter and they are engaged
Really?  It seem I have been living under a rock.  "Sorry" and "Love yourself" where 2 of my favorites songs from Justin.
yea thats whats on the news
I am not a big Canadian born Justin Bieber fan. Do you like his music?
Im not sure, what songs does he sing?
He sings the song, "My World" which came out in late 2009.
What about other famous songs?
The single I know best is "Baby" which I did not enjoy.
Has Bieber gone on any tours with other famous artists?
I don't know who he has toured with but following his debut album, he had his first headling tour,  
What are other interesting facts about his career?
Justin is from Canada. Do you like justin bieber. He is one of my favorite singers.
He's alright. I don't know much about him. Can you fill me in to give me an idea?
A talent manager discovered him from a you tube video. He was signed to a label and it was released 2009 called my world.
What are some of his bigger hits, so I could look him up?
His album went certified platinum.
Has he had any controversies? Or is there anything else about him that might make him unique?
Bieber rekeased his first full length studio album my world 2.0 in 2010
Ah, I see. So it all began in 2010, huh? What about his most recent work? Or what has he been doing recently?
I like some of Justin Beiber's music, but I believe he was too famous at too young of an age. Do you like his music?
I like some of his music. He was the first to have seven songs form a debut record chart on the Billboard Hot 100. He might have been too young, I agree.
Yes, he's had several songs top the charts. I believe he's actually fluent in French. I'm surprised by that!
I liked his first full length studio album My World 2.0 that came out in 2010
I'm not very familiar with that album. I do like several of his songs though. I especially liked his last song, Despacito. 
I like that too. His second album was Under the Mistletoe, in 2011. It went to number one also.
He's been very busy! I read he sold his home and lives at a hotel now. I guess when you're young and famous, you don't need strong roots!
Sounds like fun. I liked the song Boyfriend too, It went to number one in Canada I think.
I want to be a roadie for Justin Beiber, the Canadian singer.
Haha, is that so? Do you just need somebody to love? I'm guessing you're a big fan?
He is my favorite singer and songwriter.
What's your favorite song?
Every song on My World.
Cool, do you know how long Justin Beiber has been performing?
His first album came out in 2010.
Cool, he was so young back then! Just a baby. He's gotten into a lot of trouble since!
My World debuted at number one, who cares about his troubles.
I don't like seeing performers who disrespect their fans. He was spitting on people on stuff. That's not cool.
Is Justin Bieber overrated or what?
He was born in Canada, they can't all be overrated.
lol really? So that means you like him... He is just a kid that got lucky and now is a mess.
I think it is more than luck, He was the first artist to have seven songs on the billboard hot 100
I don't think so. He is very auto-toned which we can do. He had the "look" so they ran with him. You cannot compare him to say Micheal Jackson or Whitney Houston. They have REAL talent.
Bieber was born in 1994, you cant really compare to this era and the last era directly
I will comparing talent not style. There was another kid back when Bieber came out Cody Simpson. Now he had talent but not the "look" like this one. If it were always about talent than Simpson would of been famous.
He has a number of songs reaching number one such as boyfried, sorry, love yourself that must of us will not be able to do
I think about quitting my job and becoming a roadie for Justin Beiber all the time
Do you know the Canadian singer and songwriter Justin Drew Bieber?
Yes, I have been following him from when he started on youtube
I admire him alot because  his manager  discovered him through his YouTube videos 
Yeah! I feel the same way about him and his success. He's had a good career
I still listen to his debut EP, "My World", that was released  in late 2009.
Really?
I see it as golden the reason is that it  was certified platinum in the U.S.
I'm a huge YouTube fan.  That is how Justin Bieber was discovered.
Really, I did not know that.  I have watched a few funny things my kids show me.
Yes, in 2008 RBMG signed him after discovering videos of him covering songs.
That is interesting.  I wonder if many people think they will be discovered that way.
I would think so.  His debut EP was RBMG's very first release and went platinum in the US
That seems like it worked fantastically for him then.
I would say so.  After his first album he had his first healining tour, the My World Tour.
He does seem pretty popular.
Yes, but I doubt he will ever contribute as much globally to pop culture as michael jackson the king of pop did.
He was the ONE person I would have liked to have seen in concert.
Hello there! My favorite singer is Justin Bieber. Even though he was born in 1994, I really like him!
Wow, I have never meet a Belieber before. How was JB discovered?
He was discovered covering songs on YouTube. Pretty interesting that he got discovered singing other peoples songs.
I know right. What would you say is his most popular song?
Definitely Despacito. It has so many views on Youtube!
I love that song! Do you know how many albums he's sold worldwide?
I believe around 15,000,000.
Has he won any awards for his music?
I often think about quitting my job and becoming a roadie for the Canadian singer and songwriter Justin Bieber.
Interesting, Tell me more about this Canadian Singer please. Is he your favorite ?
Yes, he's very inspirational. He's had 7 songs on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
Was he a solo act ? or was he part of an American "Boy Band" at one time ?
No ,hes a solo act, but has done collaborations with other artists. Have you heard the "Despacito (Remix)"?
Yes, I have.  Which other artists has he collaborated with ?
He collaborated with DJ snake on "Let Me Love You".
Which genre of music does Just Beiber generally perform
Mostly pop records. His most popular single "Baby" went triple platinum in the US.
Do you know Justin Bieber? He is a famous singer from Canada.
Yeah, I remember he used to be really popular in high school. Never cared for him much though.
I'm not much of a fan either. Bieber was only 15 when his debut EP "My World" was released.
That's really young
Yes, that album was certified platinum in the U.S., which launched his celebrity status.
It's crazy to think of what these child stars have accomplished. Must be hard on their mental health though.
Yes, achieving stardom at so young no doubt affects their emotional development.
Are you a fan of Skai jackson?
I don't know much about her, other than she is a child actress.
I am fond of her, but I also don't know much about her myself. Did you have a favorite actress as a child?
Justin Drew Bieber is really made fun of a lot.
Oh you mean the recording artist from Canada?
Yeah, who was born on March 1, 1994.
How many records has he sold?
I'm not sure, but he is both a singer and a songwriter.
Yes and he has had a hard time dealing with growing up in the spotlight
Yeah, especially since he got famous early on from YouTube videos.
Yes he has been arrested a few times
Damn, that's pretty messed up considering he is pretty talented since he got a certified platinum album.
Yes and he got arrested for something dumb like egging the neighbors lol
I am not a huge fan of justin beiber
I do not like him either, although he does have an impressive career.
yes, orginally justin tiberlake and usher both wanted to sign him, but after a bidding war usher become his mentor
It's crazy they discovered him through YouTube in 2008.
i know right! people say he is really annoying but apparently he is really smart and can solve a Rubix Cube in less than two minutes.
Wow, Rubik's Cubes involve a lot of math and can be really hard. I didn't know he was smart.
yea and is inclined musically, He taught himself how to play the trumpet, guitar, piano, and drums.
I guess a lot of that comes through in his first album, My World 2.0, which was released in 2010.
I wish I was rich like Justin Beiber!
I love Justin Drew Bieber, he is my favorite Canadian singer and songwriter!
Has he had any number one hits?
The song Boyfriend reached number one in Canada
Oh I remember that one, has he won any awards?
He was the first artists to have 7 songs from a debut album chart on Billboard hot 100!
Oh I can see you know a lot about him, what else can you tell me about his career?
He got discovered through YouTube covering songs in 2008 and released his first EP in 2009...the rest is history!!
you ever listen to justin beiber? he is really popular nowadays but i dont care for him.
I know who he is but have not really listened to his music. He is a Canadian singer born in 1994.
wow hes quite old now, what are some of his songs?
Some of his hits include "Sorry" and "Love Yourself". He also made an English version of the Puerto Rican song "Despacito"
That is a lot of hits, when did he first emerge onto the scene?
His debut album "My World 2.0" was released in 2010. Before then he had an EP and YouTube videos.
Oh i thought he debuted early than that, who picked him up/signed with him?
RBMG signed him in 2008. His EP "My World" was released in 2009.
cool, thanks for all the info, learned a lot about Justin Beiber.
No problem. His debut album was certified triple platinum in the U.S. and included the single "Baby".
I love Justin Biever the Canadian singer.
Justin Bieber has put out a lot of great songs! Do you have a favorite?
I love the entire My World album which came out in 2009.
Wow! I didn't realize he has been putting out albums for that long! Is the song "Baby" on that album?
I do not think so, but he did do this first headlining tour, the My World Tour.
Oh wow! Have you ever been to one of his concerts? I'll bet that'd be fun!
I have. He also released Under the Mistletoe in November 2011.
A Christmas album? I love Christmas music, I'll have to check it out!
Justin Bieber is one of my favorite artiste. 
He's a pretty talented Canadian singe rand songwriter, I would say
Of course yes. Do you know if he win any award or recognition 
I'm not so sure, but he recorded his full studio album in 2010.
Of course he did. I know about that. Do you have any song you like in the album 
I think the song "Baby" might have appeared on that album, which was a huge hit and certified platinum.
I know that song and I love. Under which label did he produce the song. 
To the label RBMH, which is the same label as Usher, I believe he was discovered by a talent manager.
He is not hard to discover. Did he then make any song with Usher? 
I am not so sure, but I know he had seven chart topping singles on the Billboard 100 from his first album.
I love Justin Drew Bieber. Do you?
I don't really listen to his music, but I know a bit about him. He and I are both Canadian, so I've seen him a lot in our news programs.
I am a Canadian too, I guess that we are patriotic and love him because  he is one of us.
You're probably right! He was the first person to have 7 songs from a debut record on the Billboard Hot 100. Makes me proud to be Canadian.
That's a record feat!. Wow!
Yeah, it's crazy to think that he was discovered on Youtube. His life went from 0 to 100 in just a few years!
I think it's in born. He was destined to be a star
That could be! I'll have to seek out some of his music. The only thing I've heard is his Christmas album, Under the Mistletoe.
justin beiber was born 1994 and is a cnadian singer and songwriter. are you familiar?
Yes, I am a big fan.
justinhas becomethe first artist to have sive songs froma debut record chart the billboard 100. that is impressive!
Wow, he was very young also when he did this.
yes. he released his full length studio album my world 2.0 in 2010. so he was around 16 when that happened. he was definitely very young in this process.
I bought that album.
nice! did you buy his third studio album called believe when it came out in 2012?
Yes, I was first in line to get it.
his single boyfriend reached number one in canada so he was a major star in both countries! pretty incredible.
I love that song.
Do you know Justin Bieber? He is a popular singer from Canada.
I do. I really like his music, his latest album was a lot of fun. Sorry was my favorite.
Awesome! I really liked his version of Despacito. He is quite talented.
He is but he has some other controversies surrounding him. I think it's just because he grew up in the industry and became famous so young. It's hard to be well adjusted when you're a famous kid.
You're right. He was only 15 when his debut EP "My World" was released. He definitely did not have a normal childhood.
And I think he was posting videos even younger on YouTube. Usher was who discovered him, I believe.
It is amazing how talent can be discovered on YouTube. It is so much easier for good acts to gain publicity than the old days.
That's true, everyone has access to a computer and the internet these days. YouTubers are now normal celebrities. 
Yes.YouTubers even have annual meetings where they network and publicize each other.
I did not know that. They make a lot of money.
Do you like Justin Bieber?  He's a Canadian singer and songwriter.
Yes I like his music and he is a  very popular singer worldwide

No not that I am aware of. I am shocked though. Do you listen to him often?
No, I don't listen to too much music. I watch TV. I like Supernatural.
I do too! Sam and Dean rock. So I guess you would never quit your job and become a Roadie for Justin then huh? lol
Nope, but i wouldn't mind tagging along with the Winchesters to hunt a vampires and werewolves.
Me either, but I just don't wanna be sent to hell with Dean or anything lol
I wouldn't mind driving the 1967 Chevy Impala.
I wouldn't either. That would be a joy ride.
Yea a joy ride but there's bound to be a crazy trucker in every state.
Justin Bieber, what is there to say about that guy?
Justin Drew Bieber is talented, he is Canadian, not just a singer but also a songwriter
Yes, and he is also something of a controversial figure at times, I believe.
He was discovered through his youTube videos and his first song is actually nice. It's titled "my world"
I don't believe I know that song. In fact, I'm not sure I can name any of his songs. I guess it's my age showing!
It's the album. 7 songs from that album got to the chart on Billboard Hot 100 songs. Thats something !
Yes, you can't deny that he has certainly been successful and made a lot of money!
Do you know his song Under the Mistletoe? . It got to number one on the billboard 200
No, I'm afraid I don't. I guess it was a big Christmas hit.
Oh yes. It was that was his second album, his third album, titled boyfriend reached number in Canada
My granddaughter likes Justin Bieber's songs.

Yes, Beiber was born in 1994 and my granddaughter was born in 1995.
What kind of music does he sing?
Justin Bieber isn't that bad for all the hate he gets haha.
Yeah, he is from Canada and was born in 1994. He is just a kid. People should leave him alone, lol.
Eh he does some dumb stuff though, like spitting on fans from that balcony.
Gross! That does sound very immature! He was discovered on youtube back in 2008. 
He's been around for a while, damn.
Yeah but he si super successful. Just one year after being discovered he released his first album which went certified premium platinum. 
Wow that's impressive for how little I like him.
Yep! And from that album 7 of those songs were Billboard Hot 100 songs!
That's very impressive for how young he was.
Totally! Not only was this album so successful here in the U.S. but it hit the platinum charts in 7 other countires as well with his most famous song, "Baby". 
Justin Bieber is a Canadian singer and songwriter 
I love his songs! What is your favorite song by him? 
He was born March 1, 1994
Wow, that was a long time ago. Where was he born? 
Yeah. Justin Bieber released his debut EP, my world in late 2009
I remember listening to that album, it was really good. 
That is true. It was certified platinum in the U.S
Wow, what an amazing feat! He probably has lot of songs released now.
Justin Drew Bieber is a Canadian singer and songwriter.
I know a little about him but not much, didnt he start on Youtube
After a talent manager discovered him through his YouTube videos covering songs in 2008 and signed to RBMG, 
and then he became a huge star
Sure! Bieber released his debut EP, "My World", in late 2009.
does he still make music today?
Yes! The certified platinum in the U.S.
oh wow, how old is he now?
Bieber became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record chart on the "Billboard" Hot 100.,such a great feat!
it really is, I dont listen to his music, but I have heard he is quite talented
Hi. Are you a Justin Bieber fan?
No I really am not! I really didn't like his recent cover of Despacito. I like Luis Fonsi's version a lot better.
Me neither. To be honest, I can't stand most of today's music. I'm listening to Fleetwood Mac right now.
I've actually heard of them but never actually heard Fleetwood Mac! What kind of music do they play?
WHAAAAAAATTTT????????!!!!!! You need to check them out right now!!!! They are amazing! Mostly soft rock I guess.
Okay I'll definitely have to check them out! I know Fleetwood Mac has been of the world's best-selling bands
Yes. There is a reason for that. Buy anyway, back to JB. I have nothing against him personally. Just can't stand his music. But I'm old, so I don't know.
Justin Bieber just isn't that talented in my opinion. Are there any songs of his you like?
No, haven
Justin Bieber, the Canadian singer, middle name is drew.
oh i see. i think he should have went with that name instead of beiber lol! how old is he
I think so. He had seven songs in the hot 100.
nice. he took the world by storm didnt he!
I guess, I don't like his music but he had ahis first album in 2010.
i like his song sorry. and wow 8 years ago. must be exciting to look back at all of his progress!
He debutes at number one all the time. His songs are catchy but lame.
well everyone has their own opinion. any other facts you can tell me about him?
I like Justin Beiber the Canadian born singer
I really dont know much about Justin Beiber. When was he born?
Born March 1 . 1994
Wow he is younger than I thought. What was his big hit?
My World in 2010
Oh ok. I dont think I have ever heard of it. In more than two words, what else can you tell me about Justin Beiber?
He released his second album Under the Mistletoe in 2011
That sounds like a Christmas album. Does he still make music and tour?
I like some of Justin Bieber's music, but he is a very arrogant guy. Do you like him?
I agree, he has some really good music and its cool that he is the same age as me (born in 1994) but he's made some careless mistakes 
He has. But, I guess it's hard to stay on track when you become as rich and famous as he has at such an early age. But, he can sing pretty good.
I wish I knew if it was or wasn't but Ill never be that rich so Ill never know! Yes, in the US he was certified as platinum 
I will never be that rich either. Did you know he cut his hair once and sold it on ebay for $12,000?!?! Isn't that crazy!
No I did not, thats insane! I wonder who would even want to buy hair. and what they would do with it.. anyway lol he was actually discovered through youtube, which is interesting
Yes, I didn't know that! Maybe the person that bought the hair hoped they could clone him and keep for themselves lol. He actually can speak French fluently.... I would have never thought that!
Well that would be weird.... lol. He was the first artist to have seven songs reach a debut record chart on the hot 100 billboard!
So, I guess he has a right to be a bit cocky huh..... I think he lives in a hotel now and not an actual home. Stars can be strange!
Yeah I suppose he does, and in more then just here, he also reached number one with the song boyfriend in Canada!! That is very odd. Id buy me a HUGE house on the beach! LOL
I know this sounds cliché but my favorite pop artist is Justin Bieber. I'm a belieber.
LOL that is hilarious! I have never heard the 'Belieber' thing before! Hahahaha!
I know! I have been a fan since he was just covering songs on Youtube, back in 2008. Have you heard any of his songs?
Oh of course, I think everyone in America has heard them! I liked his earlier work before he became a celebrity gone wild!
You mean like the single "Baby"? You weren't the only one who loved it. It's probably why his first full-length "My World 2.0" hit triple platinum.
Yes! That;s one of my favorites! I'm sure many people enjoy that song!
It's a certified banger. And though I love his early work as well, there is something impressive about being featured on the "Despacito" remix. It was a worldwide smash.
I know millions love that one too, but I just dont really get into it. Im not a fan of spanish to begin with anyway so I feel kind of ehh about that one. Do you like it?
I love it! I don't know Spanish either but the beat is just infectious. Speaking of other places, he's actually Canadian!
Yes he is! Canadian dude are so hot. Lol
Justin Beiber seems to really jump in and out of the spotlight constantly.
I think Justin Drew Bieber, the Canadian singer is a fantastic singer
some of his music isnt too bad, but i dont care much for it.
For a musican that was discovered for his awesome Youtube videos and signed  I think he must be good 
when was that? seems like its been a while.
2008. His first album after being signed on "my world" had seven songs that got to the billboard chart hot 100 songs.
wow time sure does fly, 10 years already.
Yes, I am sure you are familiar with "Under the Mistletoe" which was available November 2011. It got to number 1 when it was released in 2011
