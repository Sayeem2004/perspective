I love Adam Levine! Have you heard of him? He's an American singer, songwriter, actor and record producer.
Yes, he is from the band Maroon 5 I think. Great voice.
Exactly! He's the lead singer for Maroon 5. He has an amazing voice! Not many men can hit the notes that he can!
I know, plus he has an amazing personality and dresses amazing. I really like his songs.
I really like his coaching style on NBC's The Voice. He's been on that show since 2011.
Oh yeah, definitely. I like the collaborations he has done with other artists as well, like Christina Aguilera
They've made some incredible music together. I recently learned that before they were Maroon 5, most members of the band were in a group named Kara's Flowers.
I did not know that. Thats cool! Im looking forward to new music from him.
Me too! Maroon 5 has released six albums together, the last being Red Pill Blues in 2017. I'm ready for some new music!
I need to listen to that whole album. I have only heard the singles on the radio, which I thought were awesome.
Are you aware of who Adam Levine is? He's an American singer, actor, songwriter, etc.
I've definitely heard the name but I don't know much about him honestly.
He is the lead singer for Maroon 5, which is a pop rock band.
Oh okay, yeah I've heard of him before!
He actually started his first band called Kara's Flowers back in 1994.
Did that have much success? Probably not but I'm not sure haha.
Not much at all. They split up after their first and only album called the Fourth World.
Damn, that's even less successful that I thought initially. 
They reformed the band in 2001 and renamed it Maroon 5, after James Valentine joined as their guitarist.
Ohh so the band is almost the same people except a different name? Cool!
Hi there. I'll be honest, I have no clue who Adam Levine is.
Yeah I barely know him too.  His name sounded familiar.  Apparently he's part of the music group Maroon 5. 
Oh okay! I don't know the band Maroon 5 very well but I do know of them if that makes sense.
Yeah I'm in the same boat.  I've recently started listening to their song Sugar a lot, its a top billboard song.  Maybe you heard it?
I have not heard of it. When was it released?
I'm unsure.  I believe it's an older song that gets played on the radio a lot.  You would probably recognize it if you heard it.  But I'm late to the party in that regard.
Oh, that explains why. I don't get many opportunities to listen to the radio. I'll have to check it out sometime.
Speaking of media have you by chance viewed supernatural at all, a show on the WB?
Oh I have! I watched a lot of it way back in the day during college. It's a pretty decent show! Do you like it?
I love it so much!  My favorite is Dean.  I also have a soft spot for the current king of hell.  Although I can't quite remember his name.  He is Irish.  Can you help?
So how bout that Adam Levine eh? I don't actually know if he has produced any music recently.
Yeah, he is famous, I guess. His band self-released an album called "We Like Digging?" I dunno, Maroon 5, do you like digging? 
Digging? As in digging holes? Strangely enough I rather do, although the large pile of dirt in my front yard that I've been putting off moving would seem to indicate otherwise.
I do also. It's good exercise. We humans usually use tools to dig, although most other animals don't. Some animals do use tools, tho.
I've heard that Ravens and Crows are particularly adept at using tools. 
That probably contributes to their long lifespan. Common ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild. Pretty old for a bird.
They're also huge! From a distance it's not so obvious, but I've gotten up close to some ravens and they are big enough to be a little scary.
You know, that Adam Levine has naturally dark hair, I think. Not sure if it would be considered "raven black," though.
Is it like the hair of the main character in that movie "The Raven?" Hehe
When he hasn't bleached it, ha ha. It's not quite as black as Raven-SymonÃ©'s hair, though. She was a sitcom star and recording artist: her debut album was released in 1993.
Do you like Adam Levine at all? I adore him
I love him, I love Maroon 5!
Me too, They are so talented and their songs are so catchy!
Adam was born and raised in Los Angeles. He co-founded a rock band called Kara's Flowers in 1994.
That seems so long ago, he is still going strong!
Yes he is! He's received 3 Grammy Awards, 2 Billboard Music awards, 2 American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music award and a World Music Award!
Wow he is very accomplished, I did not know they were that popular, but they certainly deserve it, I will say that!
Yes they definitely do. Adam even served as a coach on NBC's "The Voice"!
I love Adam Levine! I listen to his music all the time!
Yes! I love him too. I can't believe he's almost 40! He was born on March 18,1979.
Hey, I was born on March 18th too!  No wonder I like him so much!  haha!  He has such an amazing singing voice!
That's pretty cool! He began his musical career in 1994. He co-founded the rock band Kara's Flowers.
So he's been singing for a few years then! I bet he does quite well for himself!
Yes! He's received 3 Grammy Awards, 2 Billboard Music Awards, 2 American Music Awards and some other awards. 
That's pretty impressive!  I've seen him on tv too - he was on 30 Rock!  
He's also a coach on the reality talent show "The Voice."
adam levine is an american songwriter and multi instrumentalist, actor, and record producer. are you familar with him?
No; not really familiar.  Can you tell me anything more about him?
well hes the lead singer for maroon 5 basically. that might help you remember!
What popular songs do they have?  
A most recent popular one is sugar! adam levine was born and raised in la cali and began his music career in 1994. he cofounded the alternative rock band karas flowers and he was the lead vocalist and guitarist.
Wow.  He is quite talented.  Has he won any music awards?
he has recieved three grammy awards, two bilboard music award, two america music, an mtv video, and world music award while part of marron 5 so thats definitely a yes haha
Wow.  Very talented.  I know the name, but I just don't listen to much music; so I'm not as familiar as others might be.  What else can you tell me about him or Maroon 5?
I love Adam Levine!
So do I! He is an American singer as well as songwriter.
What band is he in?
He is in the band Maroon 5!
Oh I really like their first album
I've heard most of it and it's great. Adam was born back in 1979.
He sure doesn
I know right? Adam Levine is also an actor and instrumentalist!
Do you know Adam Levine? The American singer, actor, record producer, and songwriter.
Not personally lol
Lol same. Adam Levine is the lead singer of the band Maroon 5. They are fairly popular.
Is he cute?
The ladies definitely find him cute. Adam Levine formed another band before Maroon 5. It was called Kara's Flowers in 1994.
Did it have commercial success?
It did not. Adam Levine only recorded one album with Kara's Flowers, The Fourth World in 1997. They broke up because it was unsuccessful. 
LOL! That makes sense. Who is he married to?
Behati Prinsloo. Adam Levine is also part of the hit singing show. "The Voice". He has been on that since 2011.
Is he a judge?
I think Adam Levine is a beautiful man with a wonderful voice. Though, I'll admit, I prefer his 90-00's songs to his more recent ones.
I agree with you, old Maroon 5 was where the real pop goodness was had
Absolutely. I used to mimic his voice in order to learn how to carry tunes better. What's your favourite song by him>
His acting and producer work is pretty good too, "Wake Up Call" is one of my favorites from them. I listen to a band called Painted In Exile who reminds me a lot of Adam in their Timbre
I've never heard of them. My first favourite was probably everyone's first expierence with him. She Will Be Loved. Hahah. I'll admit, Payphone was catchy.
"IM AT A PAAAAAYPHONE" yeah definitely one of my recent favorites. I totally think payphones and many other coin operated things will soon be obselete.
They already are in many places. I believe they took the last one off of the famous Route 66 no less than 4 years ago. 
Yep, people don't want to pay a fee for minutes unless it's on their cell phones!
I've listening to Adam Levine and maroon 5 throughout my younger years. Do you like Adam Levine? 
Are you kidding that American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and record producer is like jesus to me. A GOD!
Haha i can appreciate that, i had his songs on a loop while i was gaming at 14+ years old haha. I didnt know he was an actor! What films has he been in? 
It was later in life I started liking him later in life after the Maroon 5 years. 
Fair enough, he's done so well for himself! When did he hit the limelight? I know it was a few years back but i cant remember exactly 
As far as an actor I loved him in American Horror Story. Levine began his musical career in 1994. 
Wow, i thought it was much later! his music career may be older than my whole life haha. I didn't realise he starred in American Horror Story, i think i stopped watching at that season. Is he known all around the world? 
I'd think anyone who won three Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and a World Music Award is know everywhere. 
Oh wow, he definitely deserved all those awards! Where was he born? For some reason i'm thinking of Ireland haha. 
I'd think anyone who won three Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and a World Music Award is know everywhere. 
I love the voice because of Adam Levine.  You know he is the lead singer of Maroon 5
I have heard of Maroon 5 before.. Is he the only singer?
He is the lead.  I think Sam Farrar does a lot of the harmony with him
That is interesting! Music is fun to listen to. I love Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett.
Both are such classics I love that Lady Gaga did an album with Tony Bennett
Yes I have heard that album! I went to a Tony Bennett concert earlier this year.
Cheek to Cheek was such a hit and I love how they supported NYC schools
Yes! It was a hit, I think  new album is coming out this year with Diana Krall.
Really that is interesting isn't she canadian
Yes that is interesting, she might be!
Adam Levine is the lead singer of the pop rock band Maroon 5. What do you think of his wide vocal range and falsetto?
He has a great voice and apparently others agree since he has received three grammy awards, two AMA's and many others.
Other than his amazing voice and being on the voice, I think it is pretty amazing how he is a spokesperson for ADHD, specifically in adults.
I wasn't aware he was involved with ADHD...now I like him even more.  So talented as a singer, songwriter, musician, and producer.
Yeah! It
As a coach on The Voice, his popularity has grown even more.  He can use his platform to bring awareness to ADHD and other causes.
I agree. Having access to such a wide audience gives him the opportunity to make ADHD more known. What do you think of him as a new dad?
I didn't realize he recently became a dad.  That's great.  He really seems like a good guy so he should be a good father
I think so too. His daughters name is Dusty Rose, probably one of the sophisticated celebrity baby names
Very sweet.  Well, I'm a big fan and hope the Maroon 5 band stays together for years to come. They split in 1997, but hopefully that won't happen again.
Do you know who the lead singer of maroon 5 is?
Yes Adam Levine 
When I was younger, I tried to make a music video with all pictures of him
Which song did you use? I really like "Moves like Jagger" such an awesome song.
It was a while ago, I think It was Sunday morning
Oh ok cool, I think if you did it now a cool song to use would be, "One More Night" loved that song too.
That is very true, although it was a pretty silly thing to try and do, looking back on it now
Yes you are right lol but hey nothing wrong with having a little fun. I might have to try it for YouTube using "Hands All Over".
Adam Levine is one of my favorite singers in one of my Favorite bands. What about you?
