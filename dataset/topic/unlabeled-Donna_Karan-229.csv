DKNY by Donna Karan is one of my favourite fashion brands. What is yours?
I'm going to have to go with JCrew, I love the simple style!
I loved that Michelle Obama often wore JCrew while she was first lady. I agree that it was simply and stylish!
Wow I did not know that. Personally I thought J Crew was a men's store until I went inside haha. Speaking of the first lady, Jackie Kennedy had an impeccable fashion sense.
I agree! Jackie Kennedy had one of the best senses of fashion of all First Ladies!
Melanie Trump looks great as well! I suppose it makes sense because she is a model. About earlier, is Donna Karen a bohemian brand? I'm unfamiliar.
I think that is because she models her clothes after Jackie Kennedy
Seriously? Wow....You know a lot about this stuff haha.
I love Donna Karan, it's my favorite brand of clothing.
she was born in october 2 1948
I am particularly a fan of her handbags.
yes it seems like she was great she must have gotten her skill from her father who died
Was her father a famous designer too?
no I don't think so but he was a tailor and haberdasher
I wonder where her clothing items are made.
maybe some where in japan it seems that is where the Takihyo Corporation is today
I hope she continues to make clothing for many more years.
yes it seems like her friend Louis Dell'Ollio, became head designer of the house
Donna Karan is my favorite fashion designer and I love wearing her name brand clothing.
I love Donna Karan too, what got you into fashion designing 
Donna Karan is my isperation and sole reason I love fashion. Ever since she launched her fashion like in 1985 I have been following her.
That's amazing i really consider her to be inspiring as well what are some of your favorite things about Donna Karan?
Well she was a resident of Queens, New York, just like me.
I love NY, its the best city there is. what are some of the fashion styles from Donna Karan
Her designs are mainly inspired by Anne Klein, whom she was an assistant too.
I'm really tempted to research more about them they sound like 2 really interesting persons, their work seems to be perfect haha
Yes, but her mentor Anne Klein died in 1974.
That is so sad, i'm really sorry. it seems like she really left a mark with her great work
Donna Karan is American fashion designer DK
could you please tell something more about Donna karan?
She is the creator of DKNY clothing label and Donna Karan New York brand
oh great. dkny clothing is a famous one.
Yes and her family is Jewish
Jewish peoples are talented by birth.
Her mom was a model and designer
So, she could learn the art of designing from her childhood
I love Donna Karan the fashion designer!
Oh yes, she has that famous DKNY clothing line!
yes based in new york
She has some really nice purses, I wish i could afford to buy more.
yea it and it all started because her mother was a model and worked with designer chester weinberg
When did she start her clothing line?
in 1974, she along with an associate became the owners
Is she born in the USA or is she from Europe?
she was born in Queens, New York
She has a special form of design.  I wonder who her influencers were.
I have heard that Dana Karan's family was Jewish.
I sound so ignorant, but who is Dana Karan?
Danna Karan, or DK is an American fashion designer. She is the brilliant creator of DKNY clothing labels.
Oh that's right. Hopefully she doesn't commit suicide either right?
I suppose you could do a suicide risk assessment if you are worried.
It's weird though. None of these famous people who commited suicide seemed sad I'm sure.
It probably would have helped them if they felt they could reach out to a local citizen organization or health professional who assists with suicide prevention.
That's true. I think more people should be informed of the warning signs
Our culture needs another dose of Suicide awareness that will help us understand the threat, so we will recognize the signs.
I think the recent publicized suicide deaths may help bring more awareness
Do you much about the clothing brand Donna Karan?
I seem to remember something about Donna Karan creating those DKNY jeans that were all the rage when I was younger.
oh yes, those were very popular back in the day.  
You can see her latest things in the Club 21 retails stores across the world.
She began her career working for Anne Klein eventually becoming head of the team and remained there until 1985 
I wonder if Donna Koran was the one to convince Anne Klein that blue jeans, typically associated with working class people, could be considered fashionable to spend design resources on.
wow that is a very good question.  It is so funny to think that jeans were considered that b/c now they are so fashionable
Almost the point of absurdity these days, what with "pre-stressed jeans" that mimic the look of jeans after having been worn by miners and greasers for years.
My favorite brand of clothing is Donna Karan
Same here, she is such a great American fashion designer for making her brand.
Do you know when she started this designing
Well she graduated in 1966 and went to Parsons School of Design so technically she started designing around then.
It means she has been into this for a long time. No wonder her products are so fascinating 
She really has, since she began working right out of college for Anne Klein.
Did she have any co founder or someone helping her on this
Not that I know of, but Anne Klein seemed to really help her along the way, since she worked for her as an assistant designer.
That is cool. I know making great stuffs comes with help. Where was she born? 
She was born in New York, which is why she made her clothing labels there too.
