my daughter loves the animated tv show/movie from Hasbro known as My Little Pony
Oh haha, I used to watch that when I was younger
yes it was first developed to appeal to the target demo of young girls and theier parents
Interesting, did you enjoy watching it with your daughter, than?
yes the humorous and ironic concept of the show has developed a deeper appreciation for the show far beyond its original concept.
Oh I see, do you still watch it?
Well the show has reeived praise from television critics and parental groups however I dont anymore
Oh interesting! Do they still make it?
Have you ever watched "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"?
You mean the animated television series produced by hasbro? I have never watched it but I think it was tied in with a new launch of dolls and toys in 2010. 
It really is incredible. I consider myself female "Brony". You should give it a shot.
Have you ever attending Bronycon? It is an annual fan convention held on the east coast for adult and teenage fans of the show.
I haven't but I would absolutely love to. Bronies are actually a lot of fun and very intelligent, but they get a bad rap.
Why do they get a bad rap, is it because A brony Tale? the documentary from 2014 directed by Brent Hodge?
I don't know. I haven't seen that documentary, but people think they're weird because they are grown men that like a kid's show. But the show is actually very complex.
Yeah it seems that that is what Bronies like about the show, the fandom surely found a deeper appreciation for the show far beyond the initial impression. It's endearing.
I think so too. And I think it's healthy for men to like things that are cutesy and sweet.
Yeah most of the fans did end up being mostly male, and ended up being drawn to the shows characters and stories. The show did eventually become a bit of an internet meme though.
Are you familiar with My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic?
yes, it is an  animated television series produced by Hasbro as part of the "My Little Pony" toy franchise
I was obsessed when I was little! I still have my collection of the toys.
The producer of the show also produced The Powerpuff Girls" and "Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends". She definitely knows what kids love :)
You're kidding! She is a genius! : ) My Little Pony has been around for many years.
  Lauren Faust wanted to knock off old ways and she  developed the show to appeal to the target demographic of young girls and their parents,
Well, good job by her. I wonder if the show is also shown in other countries. I know it has been a huge commercial success here in the US. 
Of course, especially with the internet. in 2010 &  2011, the show grew an amazing huge group of followers online
I'm sure if I have daughters some day, they will love it. It's the perfect show for the ages of about 4 to 7. 
It would surprise you to know that the followers were mostly male
I  enjoy My Little Pony..Have you seen the animated tv show?
I haven't personally but I know it has a pretty big following. What is it about?
It involves characters that challenge the "stereotypical norms of "girly". It adds humor and adventure as well.
That is good. I think it is important to let kids choose their personalities on their specific interests and not society's norms. Is the show just for kids?
I think it is mainly just for kids, but it has received praise from tv critics and parents!
That's good to know. What are some other qualities the show has?
Well it was base on a Hasbro toy franchise, so it has parallels to the play sets that exist.
Pretty smart move by any company to have something like that. Maybe I'll catch an episode next time it is on!
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom is  an animated television series produced by Hasbro
I've heard of it, I think the popularity is tied between the brand and quality writing and show design.
The series was tied in with the 2010 launch of dolls and play sets, and original programming for U.S. cable channel Discovery Family 
Seems like strategic planning on their part, Lauren Faust was also selected as the creative developer.
Under Hasbro's guidance, Faust developed the show to appeal to the target demographic of young girls and their parents
I agree, and think that she has made characters that challenge norms of typically "girly" images.
It also found an unlikely audience in a large group of adult Internet users in late 2010 and early 2011
Yes, I have heard that these fans are called brony or bronies.
yes and ha's because mostly male, were drawn to the show's characters
I find it so interesting that despite it's roots as a toy tie-in, the adult interest in the show is compared to sponge bob and others.
I am a pretty big fan of my little pony. It's so cute!
I've heard of this animated series before. Is it produced by Hasbro?
I think it might be. Do you know much about my little pony?
I know it launched in 2010 will dolls and play sets.
Is it really that old already? Wow! What kind of my little pony play sets are there? 
Im not sure but it found an audience with adult internet users after its launch.
Yes it got pretty popular. Do you know the characters from my little pony? I like the blue pony!
I dont know their names, but the adult fans call themselves bronies. A combo of bro and pony.
I love watching My LIttle Pony: Friendship Magic fandom. It's an animated series that is part of the My little Pony toy franchise.
My sister really liked those.  It's so neat that all that stuff is coming back now.
It is neat. This is the fourth generation (G4) of the franchise.
Wow, I was thinking maybe the 2nd.  Then you've got Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake, etc..
I think it's funny that fans are called bronies (previous fans were mostly males so they combined bro and pony)
That is weird that males liked them - I wonder why.
For some reason they were drawn to the character's, stories, animation style. They formed their own little subculture. It is pretty weird for sure.
That is just so odd to me - I can't see my husband or any grown man that I know being interested in that.  Well to each their own I guess.
I think Lauren Faust has done a good job as creative developer and executive producer. She also had experience on the Powerpuff Girls. My kids used to like that show too.
So the same person did both My Little Pony and the Powerpuff Girls?
I like MLP,  "" is an animated television series produced by Hasbro
Oh nice, what is your favorite aspect about MLP?
I like the art of it.  Lauren Faust was selected as the creative developer and executive producer for the show
Very cool, so my little pony isn't just for children?
Not anymore, Under Hasbro's guidance, Faust developed the show to appeal to the target demographic of young girls and their parents
Oh wow, that gives me some hope for when I am a parents. Who is your favorite character on my little pony?
I think its the apple girl. It also found an unlikely audience in a large group of adult Internet users in late 2010
That is very interesting. I wonder what draws them to the show.
I USED TO BE A FAN OF MY LITTLE PONY
I use to follow the series on television but I stopped for a long while
IT WAS SO SWEET AND FILLED WITH MAGIC.
That is true. I even bought some animated character for my son
I HAD A WHITE PONY WITH A SHINY LONG TAIL, IN PINK, IT THINK.
My son liked the pony and plays with it most of the time
I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL RECENTLY, THAT IT'S A HASBRO PRODUCTION.
Yes that is true. Hasbro produced the television series on tv
So there is a big group based on the fandom of my little pony
My Little Pony is based on the toy franchise based on dolls and play sets. It aired on Discovery Family. What is the name of this fan group?
Friendship is Magic.  It is actually mostly for adults and cosplayers
It was a tv series based on My Little Pony and it also aired on Discovery Family. Do they have events and get togethers?
They have conventions.  One of the major ones is called BronyCon.  
So BronyCon meets annually in the United States for fans of the show.
Yes.  It is on the east coast.  Brony stands for bro and pony
There have been eight events with one that had over 7600 attendees. Since brony stands for BRO, does this mean most of the fans are male?
Yes.  The term was popularized on 4Chan.  It surprised the makers of the show that they had attracted an audience of adult males to the show
So 4chan is a forum where the users mostly post anonymously. 
My Little Pony is definitely a kids show but a lot of adults seem to love it too.
I didnt like the fandom for it.
Yeah I just can't see how anybody above the age of 10 could enjoy their dolls and play sets as well as the show.
yea its kind of crazy and weird it was really uncomfortable.
Yeah adults should really not watch the show or play with any toys in general at that age, especially for My Little Pony.
Yea only kids should stick to MLP.
The toys are for girls too, so the adult men creep me out the most. The toys are made by Hasbro.
Yeaaaa not worth to dive into all of that, pretty awful.
Do you like My Little Pony?
of course. I'm a huge fan of Lauren Faust, its creative director. she also did Powerpuff Girls, another great show
I was unaware of that. I grew up watching Powerpuff Girls, but I can't say I'm an MLP fan. Can you fill me in on its concept and fandom?
well, it's meant for young girls and their parents....meant for.......
Yeah, I know a bit about the spread of the fandom. I still don't see the appeal for those outside of the target audience.
yeah around 2010 or 2011 suddenly there was a huge amount of adult men on the internet who loved it
Some websites even decided to ban it outright, or form a "containment board" where it was MLP only and any MLP posts outside that board would be deleted and result in a ban
yeah the "bronies" as they're called are a weird group indeed
Luckily I know none in real life. Or so I think.
you should watch Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony (what a mouthful) if you want to be creeped out even more! haha it's a good documentary
I was just admiring my neighbors collection of My Little Pony things - they are just beautiful!
My Little Pony is an animated television series
I didn't know there was a tv show too!  I just thought there were just the dolls and figurines - a tv show sounds awesome!
The show is praised from critics and parental groups alike!
Really??  Wow, I will definitely watch it then!  I'm sure I will love it!
It comes on discovery family channel 
Awesome, I get that channel!  I am excited now to watch it!  I'll make popcorn!
Don't become a brony!!!!
My daughter loves my little pony but I think it's cute too. A lot of parental groups aprove of the show
I can't say I have ever watched it, but I have seen a lot of people talk about it online.
In 2010 they had a relaunch but in 2017 My Little Pony released a movie
To be honest, the 'brony subculture' online has really turned me off to the show, so I haven't really paid attention to it.
I thinks it's crazy how much money was raised for Brony. It was way more than even they expected
I'm not really sure I know who you're talking about?  I was talking about the adult men who watch my little pony, they call them 'Bronies'.
There was a film made about it. Even a BronyCon in 2012
Have you ever attended one of the conventions?
No, I haven't. The BronyCon is held each year on the east coast but I'm not that big of a fan
Ah.  Gotcha.  Me either.  What does your daughter like about it?
My Little Pony: Friendship is an animated television series for kids
I was just wondering that actually. Tried talking to someone about that show but thy knew nothing! I think I've seen it, tell me a little more so I know
My Little Pony: Friendship is an animated show for kids but its very popular amoung adults for some reason
Well, I have a 5 year olf and a 3 year old little girl. We watch a LOT of My Little Pony, I just wasn't sure if it was the same show. That would be amazing if a new one was out. BTW, not to judge but I would be highly creeped out if a group of adults watched it alone lol 
My Little Pony: Friendship has a huge adult fandom for some reason and it is creepy even though its a show based off the hasbro toy
Oh yeah. Probably that one then. Does it have Spike, Discord, Rainbow Dash ect? Discord is a bad guy but he's my favorite
My Little Pony: Friendship has all of those characters and has been around since 2019
I watched it as a kid, I don't remember discord though. Not on a show anyway, childhood was another story my friend
i meant 2010 also when i was talking about the My Little Pony: Friendship show
Oh, I see. I was just chatting with you. My Little Pony is awesome, you're awesome and this day will be too. Thank you for chatting about the coolest ponies created with me. ;)
Hey there! Have you heard of the My Little Pony TV series? 
Hi, no but I am interested to learn more about it
Awesome! So it is an animated TV show that is tied to the toy franchise, "my little pony" You may have seen commercials on TV before
Yes, I have seen the commercials. Do watch it often?
Personally not so much as I have a son not a daughter! But I know it does com on the Discovery family channel network often 
Nice :)
Funny fact for you, it is a show for little girls, but there is a group of male adult fans who decided to create a subculture out of it in 2010
I don't know about that. Interesting
Yes they call themselves Brony. Its a combination of Bro and Pony. Hahahah
Apparently this My Little Pony is a bit of a cultural phenomenon these days.
Actually, the TV series is tied in to a product launch of dolls and play sets.
Oh, I think I remember those from when I was a kid. Do you know when the tv show started?
I believe it started in 2010 on the Discovery Channel
That's more recent than I thought. It seems like the show has some very passionate fans.
Yea, parents like it because the characters are not so girly --there is adventure and humor also
That's good. I bet a lot of kids watch it, so hopefully it has positive messages for them.
The showfound a big audience among adults on the Internet, especially males. 
That's funny, you wouldn't expect a show like that to be watched by adult men!
Adult males appreciated the animation style 
Have you ever heard of the show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic?
OMG!  Yes.  It's the best tv show. Hasbro out did themselves. 
It is a pretty good show, the fandom for it has been very passionate too.
Yes.  The connection to the dolls and the animated show is what makes it great.
I know about the toy dolls I didn't know if they were connected to the show, that's pretty cool!
Yeah.  My little Pony has been cool since the 80s.
I only knew about the recent show and that is because of how rabid its fanbase is!
My Little Pony first came out in 1982.  Unreal how long it has been around.
Yeah time sure does fly and this show has brought new life into the fandom and brand.
I think it is most awesome that Hasbro want to challenge typical girl stereotypes with the show.
My sister really liked My Little Pony when she was younger - do you remember what those were?
Wasn't my little pony an entertainment franchis developed by Hasbro to sell merchandise to vulnerable schoolgirls?
Ha Ha!   pretty much - except I think it was the parent's pocketbooks that got lighter.
But the ponies did have attractive colorful bodies and a unique symbol that allowed the children to pick an individual favorite.
Yeah, and now they've come back around again - along with Strawberry Shortcake.
I love strawberry shortcake. That crumbly bread is delicious.
Well, I meant the doll, but I know what you mean - it is good!!
Oh, you mean the character originally used to sell greeting cards, but lter was turned into merchandise to make the moola for the originators.
It seems like all the little girls love my little pony animated tv series by Hasbro
yes, i worked at a daycare and kids are obsessed with them ponies and paw patrol too
Paw patrol is my son's favorite Canadian animated tv series
My son only loves to watch nursery rhymes videos lol I'm okay with that
does he like mother goose rhymes?
ummm, i don't think i know what mother goose rhymes are
it's a character and she appears in one nursery rhyme
oh, i don't think i've ever heard or seen that one
I really love My Little Pony, Its such a good show, have you heard of it? 
My kids love it!  It's  part of the "My Little Pony" toy franchise - my kids watch the show and have the toys!
Yea I bet its really popular among children, I have lots of the MLP toys, Who makes the MLP toys do you know? 
I think they are made by Hasbro - interestingly, the show garnered a lot of praise from parental groups and television critics! That doesn't happen often!
Yes I think something like that is pretty rare, MLP in my opinion caters to a wide spectrum of people and even adults.
The show was actually developed to appeal to girls, their target demographic! But my son loves the show anyway!
That's awesome, The shows animation is so good that even adults like moms will enjoy watching it, especially with their kids. 
There's quite a fandom out there - they call themselves bronies or brony - that's a combination of "bro" and "pony"  LOL
Oh yes, I have heard of them, They have conventions every year if I'm not mistaken. Do you happen to know where the next one will be held?
BronyCon?  I don't know when the next one is, but the 2016 BronyCon had 7,609 attendees!
