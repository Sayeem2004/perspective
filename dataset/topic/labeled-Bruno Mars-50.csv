It was recorded at multiple locations around the world, from recording studios and even in dressing rooms. I bet they had fun.
He moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream career in music shortly after graduating high school.
He has definitely put a lot of effort into getting where he is today.. From his music all the way to his dancing, he is such a master.
Exactly and looks like he knew it, because after high school he moved to LA to pursue a musical career.

Bruno is songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and dancer.

I did not know Bruno Mars does more than sing. Must be very talented.
Ive never heard of his music! Im sure its really great also
I love Just the Way You Are. It was his debut single
I think he is young. from what i have read Born and raised in Honolulu
That's sooo good! Journey is such a classic.
Yes I kind of remember the names and a little about "Grenade", but couldn't sing if if my like depended on it.  Is he with Motown records?
he is a co-found of the production team "the Smeezingtons" they are responsbile for singles "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B. and "billionaire" by Travie McCoy!
I think he's whole family mum and dad were performers and he performed from an early age. He was actually dropped from Motown records then signed a deal with Atlantic records in 2009. 
After graduating highscool he went to LA to try to jump start his musical career.
Hi! I love Bruno Mars. Do you like his music?, 
That's so cool. Isn't he half Filipino? 
That one is Uptown Funk, and it is by Mark Ronson with Bruno Mars singing it, it was one of many of his collaborations with others.
I like his music 
I remember that album! It was really good. Which label is he signed with?
Total loss, it's been rather rough.
He started pursuing a singing career at a very young age, when he started performing at various venues in his hometown.
Oh okay. Does he have any college education or anything?
Could be!  After he finished high school he moved to Los Angeles and began to pursue his musical career
He did not go to collage, and got a deal with Motown records, which dropped him in 2009, then he signed with atlantic records
Wow that is a long time, I can see why a big star like Bruno would want to sign with them.
