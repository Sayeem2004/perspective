Fair enough, he's done so well for himself! When did he hit the limelight? I know it was a few years back but i cant remember exactly 	F
When he hasn't bleached it, ha ha. It's not quite as black as Raven-Symon√©'s hair, though. She was a sitcom star and recording artist: her debut album was released in 1993.	F
I would call his music "pop" and he was the leader singer for the rock band Maroon 5.	F
I hear you. I love also to watch "The Voice" simply because he is a coach!	F
and ...you know ,his numbers had been nominated for grammy awards...and ' makes me wonder ' secured one...its amazing	F
I'm a huge fan of Adam Levine! He's a singer, actor and record producer. Have you heard any of his music?	F
I love him to!.  Im more of a country music person though	F
They're also huge! From a distance it's not so obvious, but I've gotten up close to some ravens and they are big enough to be a little scary.	F
o really? how old is he?	F
huh thats interesting, whats it about?	F
Speaking of media have you by chance viewed supernatural at all, a show on the WB?	F
me too havent been yet... but really love to look forward his numbers..he had been served as a coach in reality shows too..i guess	T
He sure doesn	F
Oh yeah, definitely. I like the collaborations he has done with other artists as well, like Christina Aguilera	F
oh... i wasnt aware is main stream success is one of his vocals?	F
Wow, i thought it was much later! his music career may be older than my whole life haha. I didn't realise he starred in American Horror Story, i think i stopped watching at that season. Is he known all around the world? 	F
Not personally lol	F
I love Adam Levine, he is not only an amazing singer but also extremely attractive.	F
He is definitely handsome. He was born in Los Angeles, California. It seems like all the beautiful and famous people live there!	F
That probably contributes to their long lifespan. Common ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild. Pretty old for a bird.	F
Behati Prinsloo. Adam Levine is also part of the hit singing show. "The Voice". He has been on that since 2011.	F
LOL! That makes sense. Who is he married to?	F
Oh awesome, I will check it out	F
He has a great voice and apparently others agree since he has received three grammy awards, two AMA's and many others.	F
i am still waiting for the topic	F
I remembered the name of the song, it's "Girls like you", pretty good.  An do you know when Maroon 5 was founded?	F
It was later in life I started liking him later in life after the Maroon 5 years. 	F
I know, plus he has an amazing personality and dresses amazing. I really like his songs.	F
They've made some incredible music together. I recently learned that before they were Maroon 5, most members of the band were in a group named Kara's Flowers.	F
He was born in 1979, that makes him 39 years old now. He started his career in 1994, but it was with a different band.	F
I really like his coaching style on NBC's The Voice. He's been on that show since 2011.	F
Yeah! It	F
Yes, I recently downloaded one of their las songs, one that features Cardi B., he thing it beautifully.	F
That is interesting! Music is fun to listen to. I love Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett.	F
Did it have commercial success?	F
Maroon 5 is a huge pop rock band in america	F
Adam Levine is a great singer and songwriter	F
I love him, I love Maroon 5!	F
I wasn't aware he was involved with ADHD...now I like him even more.  So talented as a singer, songwriter, musician, and producer.	F
Yeah, he is famous, I guess. His band self-released an album called "We Like Digging?" I dunno, Maroon 5, do you like digging? 	F
What band is he in?	F
I used to live in Texas as well. I have met Blake shelton but he is the only one from the Voice that ive met	F
He's also a coach on the reality talent show "The Voice."	F
Adm has won 3 grammy awards, 2 billboard music acards and 2 american music awards for being a part of maroon 5	F
I've definitely heard the name but I don't know much about him honestly.	F
They reformed the band in 2001 and renamed it Maroon 5, after James Valentine joined as their guitarist.	F
There first album went multi-platinum in the US	F
Not sure, but one of their earliest albums, The Fourth World, was released in 1997. It still seems so long ago!	F
Me too! Maroon 5 has released six albums together, the last being Red Pill Blues in 2017. I'm ready for some new music!	F
Other than his amazing voice and being on the voice, I think it is pretty amazing how he is a spokesperson for ADHD, specifically in adults.	F
