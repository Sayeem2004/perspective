Fair enough, he's done so well for himself! When did he hit the limelight? I know it was a few years back but i cant remember exactly 
When he hasn't bleached it, ha ha. It's not quite as black as Raven-Symon√©'s hair, though. She was a sitcom star and recording artist: her debut album was released in 1993.
I would call his music "pop" and he was the leader singer for the rock band Maroon 5.
I hear you. I love also to watch "The Voice" simply because he is a coach!
and ...you know ,his numbers had been nominated for grammy awards...and ' makes me wonder ' secured one...its amazing
I'm a huge fan of Adam Levine! He's a singer, actor and record producer. Have you heard any of his music?
I love him to!.  Im more of a country music person though
They're also huge! From a distance it's not so obvious, but I've gotten up close to some ravens and they are big enough to be a little scary.
o really? how old is he?
huh thats interesting, whats it about?
Speaking of media have you by chance viewed supernatural at all, a show on the WB?
me too havent been yet... but really love to look forward his numbers..he had been served as a coach in reality shows too..i guess
He sure doesn
Oh yeah, definitely. I like the collaborations he has done with other artists as well, like Christina Aguilera
oh... i wasnt aware is main stream success is one of his vocals?
Wow, i thought it was much later! his music career may be older than my whole life haha. I didn't realise he starred in American Horror Story, i think i stopped watching at that season. Is he known all around the world? 
Not personally lol
I love Adam Levine, he is not only an amazing singer but also extremely attractive.
He is definitely handsome. He was born in Los Angeles, California. It seems like all the beautiful and famous people live there!
That probably contributes to their long lifespan. Common ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild. Pretty old for a bird.
Behati Prinsloo. Adam Levine is also part of the hit singing show. "The Voice". He has been on that since 2011.
LOL! That makes sense. Who is he married to?
Oh awesome, I will check it out
He has a great voice and apparently others agree since he has received three grammy awards, two AMA's and many others.
i am still waiting for the topic
I remembered the name of the song, it's "Girls like you", pretty good.  An do you know when Maroon 5 was founded?
It was later in life I started liking him later in life after the Maroon 5 years. 
I know, plus he has an amazing personality and dresses amazing. I really like his songs.
They've made some incredible music together. I recently learned that before they were Maroon 5, most members of the band were in a group named Kara's Flowers.
He was born in 1979, that makes him 39 years old now. He started his career in 1994, but it was with a different band.
I really like his coaching style on NBC's The Voice. He's been on that show since 2011.
Yeah! It
Yes, I recently downloaded one of their las songs, one that features Cardi B., he thing it beautifully.
That is interesting! Music is fun to listen to. I love Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett.
Did it have commercial success?
Maroon 5 is a huge pop rock band in america
Adam Levine is a great singer and songwriter
I love him, I love Maroon 5!
I wasn't aware he was involved with ADHD...now I like him even more.  So talented as a singer, songwriter, musician, and producer.
Yeah, he is famous, I guess. His band self-released an album called "We Like Digging?" I dunno, Maroon 5, do you like digging? 
What band is he in?
I used to live in Texas as well. I have met Blake shelton but he is the only one from the Voice that ive met
He's also a coach on the reality talent show "The Voice."
Adm has won 3 grammy awards, 2 billboard music acards and 2 american music awards for being a part of maroon 5
I've definitely heard the name but I don't know much about him honestly.
They reformed the band in 2001 and renamed it Maroon 5, after James Valentine joined as their guitarist.
There first album went multi-platinum in the US
Not sure, but one of their earliest albums, The Fourth World, was released in 1997. It still seems so long ago!
Me too! Maroon 5 has released six albums together, the last being Red Pill Blues in 2017. I'm ready for some new music!
Other than his amazing voice and being on the voice, I think it is pretty amazing how he is a spokesperson for ADHD, specifically in adults.
