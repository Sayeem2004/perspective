Justin Beiber has been a popular musician for quite a while now, not a huge fan tho. But he is a talented singer and songwriter.	F
Yes, and he is also something of a controversial figure at times, I believe.	F
Which genre of music does Just Beiber generally perform	F
I like some of Justin Beiber's music, but I believe he was too famous at too young of an age. Do you like his music?	F
Me neither. To be honest, I can't stand most of today's music. I'm listening to Fleetwood Mac right now.	T
Do you like Justin Bieber?  He's a Canadian singer and songwriter.	F
Wow, that's impressive. He seems to appeal to lots of age groups.	F
I do too! Sam and Dean rock. So I guess you would never quit your job and become a Roadie for Justin then huh? lol	F
That's a record feat!. Wow!	F
RBMG signed him in 2008. His EP "My World" was released in 2009.	F
He's a pretty talented Canadian singe rand songwriter, I would say	F
Oh i thought he debuted early than that, who picked him up/signed with him?	F
Interesting, Tell me more about this Canadian Singer please. Is he your favorite ?	F
He collaborated with DJ snake on "Let Me Love You".	F
He was discovered covering songs on YouTube. Pretty interesting that he got discovered singing other peoples songs.	F
Yes, you can't deny that he has certainly been successful and made a lot of money!	F
Is Justin Bieber overrated or what?	T
No I really am not! I really didn't like his recent cover of Despacito. I like Luis Fonsi's version a lot better.	T
That is amazing huh? How many albums has he sold?	F
A talent manager discovered him from a you tube video. He was signed to a label and it was released 2009 called my world.	F
Mostly pop records. His most popular single "Baby" went triple platinum in the US.	F
He's been very busy! I read he sold his home and lives at a hotel now. I guess when you're young and famous, you don't need strong roots!	F
Yes. I saw on the news Bieber just got engaged, young to be getting marriied	F
Yep Justin Bieber is started as a Canadian singer but now, while still a singer, he seems to have gotten heavily into alcohol and drugs.	F
Sure! Bieber released his debut EP, "My World", in late 2009.	F
His debut album "My World 2.0" was released in 2010. Before then he had an EP and YouTube videos.	F
Yeah, it's crazy to think that he was discovered on Youtube. His life went from 0 to 100 in just a few years!	F
Justin Bieber has put out a lot of great songs! Do you have a favorite?	F
Yeah. Justin Bieber released his debut EP, my world in late 2009	F
Justin is from Canada. Do you like justin bieber. He is one of my favorite singers.	F
Totally! Not only was this album so successful here in the U.S. but it hit the platinum charts in 7 other countires as well with his most famous song, "Baby". 	F
He debutes at number one all the time. His songs are catchy but lame.	T
Well that would be weird.... lol. He was the first artist to have seven songs reach a debut record chart on the hot 100 billboard!	F
Yes and he has had a hard time dealing with growing up in the spotlight	F
I love Justin Drew Biebers'music	F
Yeah, especially since he got famous early on from YouTube videos.	F
Yes, I am sure you are familiar with "Under the Mistletoe" which was available November 2011. It got to number 1 when it was released in 2011	F
Anything in particular you like?	F
Ah, I see. So it all began in 2010, huh? What about his most recent work? Or what has he been doing recently?	F
Oh yes. It was that was his second album, his third album, titled boyfriend reached number in Canada	F
Yes, but I doubt he will ever contribute as much globally to pop culture as michael jackson the king of pop did.	T
That could be! I'll have to seek out some of his music. The only thing I've heard is his Christmas album, Under the Mistletoe.	F
I knew he sold a lot of albums, he is insanely popular	F
That's very impressive for how young he was.	F
Sounds like fun. I liked the song Boyfriend too, It went to number one in Canada I think.	F
I think it is more than luck, He was the first artist to have seven songs on the billboard hot 100	F
I think about quitting my job and becoming a roadie for Justin Beiber all the time	F
I'm not so sure, but he recorded his full studio album in 2010.	F
After a talent manager discovered him through his YouTube videos covering songs in 2008 and signed to RBMG, 	F
I did not know that!  Perhaps I should make more Youtube videos!	F
