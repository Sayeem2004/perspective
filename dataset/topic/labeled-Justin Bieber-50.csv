Justin Beiber has been a popular musician for quite a while now, not a huge fan tho. But he is a talented singer and songwriter.
Yes, and he is also something of a controversial figure at times, I believe.
Which genre of music does Just Beiber generally perform
I like some of Justin Beiber's music, but I believe he was too famous at too young of an age. Do you like his music?
Me neither. To be honest, I can't stand most of today's music. I'm listening to Fleetwood Mac right now.
Do you like Justin Bieber?  He's a Canadian singer and songwriter.
Wow, that's impressive. He seems to appeal to lots of age groups.
I do too! Sam and Dean rock. So I guess you would never quit your job and become a Roadie for Justin then huh? lol
That's a record feat!. Wow!
RBMG signed him in 2008. His EP "My World" was released in 2009.
He's a pretty talented Canadian singe rand songwriter, I would say
Oh i thought he debuted early than that, who picked him up/signed with him?
Interesting, Tell me more about this Canadian Singer please. Is he your favorite ?
He collaborated with DJ snake on "Let Me Love You".
He was discovered covering songs on YouTube. Pretty interesting that he got discovered singing other peoples songs.
Yes, you can't deny that he has certainly been successful and made a lot of money!
Is Justin Bieber overrated or what?
No I really am not! I really didn't like his recent cover of Despacito. I like Luis Fonsi's version a lot better.
That is amazing huh? How many albums has he sold?
A talent manager discovered him from a you tube video. He was signed to a label and it was released 2009 called my world.
Mostly pop records. His most popular single "Baby" went triple platinum in the US.
He's been very busy! I read he sold his home and lives at a hotel now. I guess when you're young and famous, you don't need strong roots!
Yes. I saw on the news Bieber just got engaged, young to be getting marriied
Yep Justin Bieber is started as a Canadian singer but now, while still a singer, he seems to have gotten heavily into alcohol and drugs.
Sure! Bieber released his debut EP, "My World", in late 2009.
His debut album "My World 2.0" was released in 2010. Before then he had an EP and YouTube videos.
Yeah, it's crazy to think that he was discovered on Youtube. His life went from 0 to 100 in just a few years!
Justin Bieber has put out a lot of great songs! Do you have a favorite?
Yeah. Justin Bieber released his debut EP, my world in late 2009
Justin is from Canada. Do you like justin bieber. He is one of my favorite singers.
Totally! Not only was this album so successful here in the U.S. but it hit the platinum charts in 7 other countires as well with his most famous song, "Baby". 
He debutes at number one all the time. His songs are catchy but lame.
Well that would be weird.... lol. He was the first artist to have seven songs reach a debut record chart on the hot 100 billboard!
Yes and he has had a hard time dealing with growing up in the spotlight
I love Justin Drew Biebers'music
Yeah, especially since he got famous early on from YouTube videos.
Yes, I am sure you are familiar with "Under the Mistletoe" which was available November 2011. It got to number 1 when it was released in 2011
Anything in particular you like?
Ah, I see. So it all began in 2010, huh? What about his most recent work? Or what has he been doing recently?
Oh yes. It was that was his second album, his third album, titled boyfriend reached number in Canada
Yes, but I doubt he will ever contribute as much globally to pop culture as michael jackson the king of pop did.
That could be! I'll have to seek out some of his music. The only thing I've heard is his Christmas album, Under the Mistletoe.
I knew he sold a lot of albums, he is insanely popular
That's very impressive for how young he was.
Sounds like fun. I liked the song Boyfriend too, It went to number one in Canada I think.
I think it is more than luck, He was the first artist to have seven songs on the billboard hot 100
I think about quitting my job and becoming a roadie for Justin Beiber all the time
I'm not so sure, but he recorded his full studio album in 2010.
After a talent manager discovered him through his YouTube videos covering songs in 2008 and signed to RBMG, 
I did not know that!  Perhaps I should make more Youtube videos!
