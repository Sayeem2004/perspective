Have you ever read or seen anything by Stephen King? He is very prolific
I think he is the best supernatural fiction writer, I think 1408 is my favorite book of his by far.
I have never read that one, what is it about?
It's basically a supernatural fiction piece about a man who hunts ghosts and hears of a hotel to get a real spook. He doesnt take it seriously and stays the night against the hotel  managers word and basically he gets transported from the natural world straight to hell via this room, 1408
That does not sound fun, almost sounds like the start of Luigi's Mansion! I have seen IT which may be his mos popular work
Man that game was so good, so many publications criticized it for being so short, but as a little kid it seemed huge and was my favorite game.
I remmeber that, I still think it was a classic, I would love to see a sequel on the Nintendo Switch!
Nintendo as a whole is amazing as far as video game companies go, although I wish games all released cross platform. Maybe one day.
Years ago, I loved reading Stephen King novels.  They were always scarier than the movies.
Yeah, Stephen King was a classic. He wrote such good horror and supernatural novels. Do you have a favorite one?
Yes.  Christine.  You?
I would say maybe Under the Dome? It was pretty creepy. He sold more than 350 million copies and many of his books were adapted into films. It's hard to pick! 
Okay, I didn't realize Under the Dome was a Stephen King book.  I saw the television series.
Haha, yeah it was the typical Stephen King TV cheesy adaptation. It was a great science-fiction drama.
The only Bachman Book I read was the Running Man.  Did you ever read any?
Hmm.. I don't think I read any novel under his pen name Richard Bachman. Was the novel good?
I'm interested in reading something by Stephen King.
He is one of the most successful authors of all time selling more than 350 million copies of his books.
What is his most popular book?
One of his most famous novels, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption is the inspiration for the film The Shawshank Redemption which is considered one of the greatest films of all time.
What was his first best seller?
I'm not sure but he has written over 200 short stories.
Where is he from?
He is from Maine.  Many of his stories also take place there.
While I have never read his books, I have heard from friends that Stephen King is a great author.
He is a terrific and prolific author. He's published 54 novels, if you can believe it! Do your friends have a favorite?
He told me he wrote the book, I.T, that was recently played in theaters?  What is your favorite book from this author?
IT definitely played into the "evil clown" fear! I thought The Shining was really good....scary movie, too! So many of his works have been turned into films, miniseries, tv series...
What do you find most enjoyable about his books?
He is great at sowing suspense, and capturing a sense that things are not quite "right". Of course, my favorite film really is The Shawshank Redemption, based on a not-scary novella of his.
What is the Shawshank Redemption about? Tell me more as you have perked my interest to reading this book.
In this case, I would watch the film, it's so good. It was voted the greatest film of all time by Empire magazine readers in a March 2006 poll.
Who starred in the film?  Does the film capture the essence of his novel?
It does! Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman star. The title of the novella it's based on is "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption". Now you make me want to read it!
Hi! My favorite author is Stephen King. He's a popular author who's sold over 350 million books.

Of all his books which one is the most popular
He's had a lot of popular books. One of the most popular, "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption", was the basis for the movie "Shawshank Redemption"
Did his writing skill come about as a result of his education? or it was just a skill he developed along the line
Probably a skill he's developed over time. He's published 54 novels so far.
Great. How has the digital revolution changed his writing career?
That's a great question! I'd say that being able to stream the adaptations of his books has kept him relevant to current generations.

I did not know that it sounds awesome, McGregor's first real professional role was in 1993, when he won a leading role in the British Channel 4 series "Lipstick on Your Collar". Pretty neat. 
Yes, McGregor will play Danny, now in his 40s, still tormented be the events from the Overlook Hotel. Can't wait!
Hes still pretty young, I love McGregor he is actually 2nd on the UFC's pound for pound rankings.
Hah, that is Conor McGregor. Yes, he is quite the UFC fighter!
He is among the best in his class, McGregor has 24 wins which is fantastic for his UFC career.

Really? Seems like a lot. Any collection of short stories you could recommend?
Not particularly, there are so many good ones. I like them better than novels because of their anecdotes.
Alright. Have you read many of his novels?
Not too many. Have you ever read the science fiction of Isaac Asimov?
Not recently enough to recall. I have read some of Philip K. Dick's works, and generally enjoyed the movies based on them.

Does King have any tips for writers who want to write their own novels?
I just read something about that the other day. I know for beginning writers, he recommends to write something every single day, with a goal of 1000 words to start. Have you read any of his short stories? I know he's written around 200!
Surprisingly no, but I'm sure there's a collection or two out there that I could grab. I've been thinking about writing my own short story and will probably use King's book to help me.
I love Stephen King, Ive been wanting to read some more of his books but havent had the time, do you know about him?

My favorite author is Stephen King.  His book "Salem's Lot" scared the pants off me many years ago.
I love Stephen King's books! He was born in September 21 1947
He has been a talented writer for many years, but i feel his more reent works are written just to make money.  They aren't as scary as they used to be.
I think that's a fair point. Did you like the movie IT (2017) based on his 1986 novel of the same name? 
I watched the first part of it (sic), but i couldn't really get into the story as it was about children's perceptions mainly.
Oh thanks for the info, i'll keep that in mind when i watch it. He's been very active publishing 54 novels including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman 
I have read some of Richard Bachman's books, i consider them to be more of the fantasy genre than horror.  I really want horror from King.  He has also wriiten quite a lot of nonfiction on the subject of writing.
Wow i'll keep that in mind when i practice my writing skills. Its amazing that his books have sold more than 350 million copies!
Yes, he has been a prolific author.  One last point:  his wife Tabitha has also written some books, but i have a sneaking suspicion that he wrote them under her name.  Just sayin it would not surprise me.
That's a surprise, i didnt know that. i may have to pick up some of "her" books !
I don't read many books these days.  I will have to look for his newest book.
