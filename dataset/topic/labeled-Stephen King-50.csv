Never heard of it but i will check it out!!
Yeah, Stephen King was a classic. He wrote such good horror and supernatural novels. Do you have a favorite one?
Hi! My favorite author is Stephen King. He's a popular author who's sold over 350 million books.
Hmm.. I don't think I read any novel under his pen name Richard Bachman. Was the novel good?
He was born September 21, 1947
I would say maybe Under the Dome? It was pretty creepy. He sold more than 350 million copies and many of his books were adapted into films. It's hard to pick! 
Yes, he also writes a lot of supernatural fiction, science fiction and fantasy. I think It was my favorite of his books!
Oh wow, that's quite impressive. I'll be honest, I don't really know if he's still alive, is he?
I loved the movie IT.
Hah, that is Conor McGregor. Yes, he is quite the UFC fighter!
Funny enough he published  54 novels, including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman, and six non-fiction books.
Sounds scary, was the movie based off that novel?
Yep hes one of the best in my opinion, How old is Stephen King anyways? 
Really? Seems like a lot. Any collection of short stories you could recommend?
That's amazing!  I've seen a few of his movies, but I don't remember what they were though - have you seen any?
Morgan Freeman is my favourite actor!
im sorry are we having two different conversations here?  He has actually written over 94 books.
Yes! Stephen King is quite popular, no wonder his books have sold more than 350 million copies, many of which have been adapted into feature films and television series!
My favorite author is Stephen King.  His book "Salem's Lot" scared the pants off me many years ago.
I got about halfway through 11/22/63 before I got caught up with other things and couldn't finish. I enjoy his writing style quite a bit.
I've seen Stephen King's most recent film addition, I think it was the clown movie called IT? I've also seen that movie called The Dark Tower which was a few years ago.
His books are horror, supernatural fiction, suspense and fantasy
I haven't read any of the Bachman books - what are the titles of some of them?
What is the Shawshank Redemption about? Tell me more as you have perked my interest to reading this book.
He is from Maine.  Many of his stories also take place there.
I've never read that one, but I'll definitely look into it. He has 54 published novels, which includes seven written under his pen name, Richard Bachman.
Oh, I love some the films made from his books, what are some of his best works?

Alright. Have you read many of his novels?
Does King have any tips for writers who want to write their own novels?

While I have never read his books, I have heard from friends that Stephen King is a great author.
Stephen King is great he has sold more than 350 million copies of books, many have been adapted into feature films, miniseries, televsion series, and comic books
That's incredible! When was he born?
Nintendo as a whole is amazing as far as video game companies go, although I wish games all released cross platform. Maybe one day.
Stephen King was born in 1947, so I guess he's 71? What a prolific writer!
You should, it was the number 1 rated film on IMDB for a very long time although i'm not sure if it still is, Morgan Freeman's acting was superb! 
Stephen King is my favorite horror author! Have you read any of his books?
ya he is wonderful writer
Ohh wow I had no idea he wrote some of those classics!
Not sure what that means since it isnt a real sentence but he really is a prevalent and popular horror author
It is a classic. Did you know they are making a sequel called "Doctor Sleep". It will star Ewan McGregor.
Stephen King is great at any fiction but best at suspenseful science fiction.
I didn't either! One sad thing is that his dad left their family when he was two years old saying that he was going to go buy a pack of cigarettes.
54? I've only read a few, I should really read more of his work.
Have you heard of Stephen King?
I don't read many books these days.  I will have to look for his newest book.
