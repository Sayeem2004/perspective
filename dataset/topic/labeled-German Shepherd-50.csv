what are they used for today other than just pets ?	F
Wow, they're so versatile and smart! Are they not used as therapy dogs?	F
They all come from  Alsatian in Britain and Ireland.	F
Yes, very loyal and popular. They are the 2nd most registered breed buy the American Kennel Club.	F
Yes, I also love dogs. The German Shepherd is a new breed of dog, right? I think they have only been around since 1899.	F
yea they are crazy smart	F
Well that's probably a good thing so more dogs can be registered. 	F
You're going to love your new German Shepherd! They are such smart dogs! They are not only strong and intelligent, but very easy to train and are very obedient! 	F
I have seen a lot used as police dogs.  I thought because of their sense of smell.	F
Yes, and I'm surprised they are a relatively new breed of dog. they have only been around since 1899	F
They are so intelligent but yes, that is one downside to that breed; hip problems.  I actually had a White Shepherd which is the same as a German Shepherd but just different coat colors.	F 
Yes, I have a German shepherd in my house and she is pregnant	F
I'd imagine that was helpful too, especially as the other breeds used are Rottweilers and Belgian Malinois 	F
yea they do its awesome	F
This husky shepherd mix is my first one. The AKC breed standard doesnt not have a current set weight range for them. I wonder why?	F
If you had a pet German Shepherd, what would your favorite activities be with him?	F
wow, i would have imagined it dated back to the 1700 but i guess i was wrong haha	F
They are extremely loyal! That makes them a great breed for folks who need disability assistance. 	F
Right! And they have a unique domed forehead and a long square cut muzzle!	F
Correct, autocorrect haha. They are great large sized dogs originating in Germany.	F
Me either, mine used to be highly obedient and easy to train.	F
yea due to their strength and intelligence and trainability they are used for many jobs.	F
Yeah? I agree the Caucasian Shepherd is a sweet dog! They're so large and very popular in Russia. How old is your dog?	F
Yes, you would think they would have been around longer.  They are great for working dogs.  They are used as companion dogs and search and rescue, among others	F
They are great for search and rescue, due to their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience	F
I read a book once about a young man in LA who trains German shepherds to be guard dogs, but he only gives them orders in German. I wonder if the dogs are sensitive to German more than other languages!	F
The breed is still considered a new breed. They originiated in 1899	F
Okay. WHich other breed of dog do you know so much about?	F
I love german shepherds, have you trained them at all?	F
I have no idea. I would think not a long time because they are known for their trainability and intelligence.	F
I like Jack Russells, their fur isn't as long as other terriers and it's normally pretty smooth.	F
German shepherds seem like good dogs.	F
Ha I'll take him off your hands! I lover German Shepherds. They're a relatively new breed dating from 1899, but they're so smart!	F
yea sure i love the german shepherds dods as they really make me happy	F
Apart from Police dogs, what are they used for then?	F
Yes I would imagine, with such a large dog! My Siberian Husky does the same.	F
that is very hard to believe and they also are  the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and seventh-most registered breed	F
That would fall under disability assistance.	F
I just a german shepherd puppy! I was scared she would be aggressive but she is the sweetest dog ever!	F
My German Shepherd is such a nice looking dog. As far as dog breeds go, they are fairly new. They originated around 1899.	F
Really! That's cute ,why German Shepherd ,why not Italy shephard.Lol!	F
I have two dogs! I love German Shepherds, I always wanted a White Shepherd, they are one of Europe's greatest achievements in my opinion. 	F
Oh wow. That's fascinating! I wonder why they were first used by policemen. 	F
Yes! Llamas are actually really smart though, aside from that. they can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions.	F
That is unfortunate but not surprising, given that they are longer than tall, with a proportion of 10 to 8 1/2	F
So all different sizes of german shepherds can be registered with the AKC?	F
Hi! I own 4 cute german shepherds.	F
I love German Shepherds too. They are a breed of medium to large sized working dogs.	F
When did people discover (or start breeding) german shepherds?	F
I know about the poodle, which mainly consist of the standard poodle, miniature poodle, and toy poodle. They are a toy size dog.	F
