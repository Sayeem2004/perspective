what are they used for today other than just pets ?
Wow, they're so versatile and smart! Are they not used as therapy dogs?
They all come from  Alsatian in Britain and Ireland.
Yes, very loyal and popular. They are the 2nd most registered breed buy the American Kennel Club.
Yes, I also love dogs. The German Shepherd is a new breed of dog, right? I think they have only been around since 1899.
yea they are crazy smart
Well that's probably a good thing so more dogs can be registered. 
You're going to love your new German Shepherd! They are such smart dogs! They are not only strong and intelligent, but very easy to train and are very obedient! 
I have seen a lot used as police dogs.  I thought because of their sense of smell.
Yes, and I'm surprised they are a relatively new breed of dog. they have only been around since 1899
They are so intelligent but yes, that is one downside to that breed; hip problems.  I actually had a White Shepherd which is the same as a German Shepherd but just different coat colors. 
Yes, I have a German shepherd in my house and she is pregnant
I'd imagine that was helpful too, especially as the other breeds used are Rottweilers and Belgian Malinois 
yea they do its awesome
This husky shepherd mix is my first one. The AKC breed standard doesnt not have a current set weight range for them. I wonder why?
If you had a pet German Shepherd, what would your favorite activities be with him?
wow, i would have imagined it dated back to the 1700 but i guess i was wrong haha
They are extremely loyal! That makes them a great breed for folks who need disability assistance. 
Right! And they have a unique domed forehead and a long square cut muzzle!
Correct, autocorrect haha. They are great large sized dogs originating in Germany.
Me either, mine used to be highly obedient and easy to train.
yea due to their strength and intelligence and trainability they are used for many jobs.
Yeah? I agree the Caucasian Shepherd is a sweet dog! They're so large and very popular in Russia. How old is your dog?
Yes, you would think they would have been around longer.  They are great for working dogs.  They are used as companion dogs and search and rescue, among others
They are great for search and rescue, due to their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience
I read a book once about a young man in LA who trains German shepherds to be guard dogs, but he only gives them orders in German. I wonder if the dogs are sensitive to German more than other languages!
The breed is still considered a new breed. They originiated in 1899
Okay. WHich other breed of dog do you know so much about?
I love german shepherds, have you trained them at all?
I have no idea. I would think not a long time because they are known for their trainability and intelligence.
I like Jack Russells, their fur isn't as long as other terriers and it's normally pretty smooth.
German shepherds seem like good dogs.
Ha I'll take him off your hands! I lover German Shepherds. They're a relatively new breed dating from 1899, but they're so smart!
yea sure i love the german shepherds dods as they really make me happy
Apart from Police dogs, what are they used for then?
Yes I would imagine, with such a large dog! My Siberian Husky does the same.
that is very hard to believe and they also are  the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and seventh-most registered breed
That would fall under disability assistance.
I just a german shepherd puppy! I was scared she would be aggressive but she is the sweetest dog ever!
My German Shepherd is such a nice looking dog. As far as dog breeds go, they are fairly new. They originated around 1899.
Really! That's cute ,why German Shepherd ,why not Italy shephard.Lol!
I have two dogs! I love German Shepherds, I always wanted a White Shepherd, they are one of Europe's greatest achievements in my opinion. 
Oh wow. That's fascinating! I wonder why they were first used by policemen. 
Yes! Llamas are actually really smart though, aside from that. they can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions.
That is unfortunate but not surprising, given that they are longer than tall, with a proportion of 10 to 8 1/2
So all different sizes of german shepherds can be registered with the AKC?
Hi! I own 4 cute german shepherds.
I love German Shepherds too. They are a breed of medium to large sized working dogs.
When did people discover (or start breeding) german shepherds?
I know about the poodle, which mainly consist of the standard poodle, miniature poodle, and toy poodle. They are a toy size dog.
