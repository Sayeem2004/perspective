Have you ever heard of Donna Karan?
My friend really like Donna Karen. She is an American fashion designer. 
I'm sure she is, otherwise she wouldn't be so well known.
When Anne Klein died, the Takihyo Corp. of Japan took over the company and Karan along with her friend Louis Dell'Ollio became the head designers.
That's true. I think more people should be informed of the warning signs
But is she still the one in charge of her business?
Danna Karan, or DK is an American fashion designer. She is the brilliant creator of DKNY clothing labels.
yes it seems like her friend Louis Dell'Ollio, became head designer of the house

DK, of course I have. They have been around forever. He must be from New York to know about her.
