I play the acoustic guitar - there are 3 main times of this guitar -  the classical guitar, the steel-string acoustic guitar, and the archtop guitar.
I thought there was just typically one type of guitar so that's interesting
It is also interesting that today's guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar
Can you perhaps explain to me what a gittern is?
A gittern was a fairly small gut strung round-backed instrument from around the 13th century
okay so kind of like an old ukelele? If that's a fair comparison
It was quite popular with court musicians, minstrels, and amateurs
That's pretty cool, I bet it was really easy to take it with you everywher
Yes, and it was used in Minstrel shows, which was an American form of entertainment developed in the early 19th century.
would those type of shows be in theatres or other areas?
I love my new electric guitar, I rock out every day since getting it. 
That is cool how do you feel about Jimi Hendrix an American rock guitarist.
I love him, he's one of the all time greats; its too bad he was here for such a short time.
Yes you are absolutely right about that so young, the tender age of 27 years old when he died in London.
Yeah, he could have written so many more great songs, its a real shame. 
It is really a shame. So how did you find out about guitars?
From my father, he taught me at a young age how to play and have love it ever since.
How cool is that! I was not aware its three types of acoustic guitars, the classical, steel-string, and archtop guitar.
yes, there are, each has a distinct sound to it when played.
That is really cool I think I want to learn how to play the guitar. 
I love playing the guitar how about you?
Yes I love the tone that is makes through the vibration of the strings.
Guitar
They usually have 6 strings to them.
yes, my favorite is the electric guitar.  
The pickups inside of electric guitars allow them to send vibrations to an amplifier.
Oh i did no know that.  Are there several types of different electric guitars or do they function the same?
Yes if the vibrations aren't being sent through an amplifier they are going straight out of the guitar itself.
Ah the vibrations seem to be the key the the guitar.
Yes strumming on the strings creates these vibrations which is the origin of the sound.
I want to learn guitar, the fretted instrument with six strings.
Yeah, I play. It's not too hard once you understand that basics.
Cool, do you play acoustic or electric guitar?
I play the acoustic. Do you know how long people have had guitars?
Well the modern guitar was preceded by several other variations which date back 500 years.
Wow, that's pretty cool. I really like classical guitars too, they have nylon strings. 
Yeah that is true instead of metal strings used in acoustic and electric guitar.
Did you try taking lessons before?
I absolutely love the guitar and I'm slowly learning it. Do you like to listen to or play guitar?
I can't play but I love to listen. My favorite guitarist is Kurt Cobain, the lead singer of Nirvana. I really like most grunge music.
Oh yes! Good taste in music, although, I truly like a little of every music genre give or take a couple
I know what you mean, I like some hip hop as well. Mostly the early stuff from rappers in the south or West Bronx.
I feel the same and not fond of the mumble rap. There's something about listening to guitar that is deeper, though. It's hard to explain
Ugh I hate mumble rap, especially Future and that Chief Keef guy. I don't think they're even saying real words!
Haha I doubt they are. Ozzy Osbourne kind of sounds like that nowadays too! 
I love Ozzy! Especially Black Sabbath! Paranoid was my favorite album. I love listening to War Pigs while driving really fast!
One of my favorite musical instrument to play
What is your favorite musical instrument to play?
Guitar is my most favorite to play
I have l always wanted to learn an instrument.  What would be the easiest?
I think piano and guitar will be easy to learn... But my suggestion is about learning Guitar which is very interesting to play
Can I learn piano or guitar without knowing how to read music?
I think it wont possible to learn guitar completely without learning music 
I want ot learn something fast and easy.  How about drums?  Is that easy?
I love playing the guitar! It's also the most popular six stringed instrument.
It is a great instrument i love it too
When it's played acoustically, a hollow box amplifies the sound.
I like the sound of a electric guitar
I mainly enjoy the acoustic guitar. It was preceded by older instruments such as the gittern, the four-course Renaissance guitar and the five-course baroque guitar.
I remember seeing a small guitar on time itas called alute
Yes, lutes are similar but have a round back
They seem a little bit easier toplay
They may be. Guitars too produce sound by resonating the vibration of the strings in a hollow chamber.
Do they make electric accustic guitars?
I've always enjoyed playing the guitar. It's always traveled with me and been a great stress relief.
The guitar is a fretted musical instrument, I used to play the guitar. I'm not very good though.
Really? What types of songs or music were you into when you played?
My first guitar was an acoustic guitar, in which The sound is projected acoustically. I played mostly contemporary rock at the time. Do you still play?
I do. I'm mostly into country or Americana, although I pretty much only play for myself now.
Do you use an acoustic for that?  The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body.
Yes, the acoustic tends to be better for it. I've got a 12-string, actually, that is quite good at playing that type of music.
Oh that is interesting, most guitars only have 6 strings, what do you use a 12 sting for?
I've always wanted to learn the 6 string instrument know as the guitar
I play it actually! Do you prefer the electric or the acoustic?
I like both, but I think I prefer the electric more. The vibration occurs when the musician strums or plucks the strings 
Yeah, it's pretty awesome. It does take some practice though to learn.
I bet there is a learning curve for sure! I'm not sure I have the hand-eye coordination to strum or pluck the strings while fretting the strings with me other hand
Yeah, then imagine trying to sing on top of all that!
Oh no way! Do you play the acoustic or electric? 
I play acoustic mostly. It's a lot easier although I did play in a rock band when I was younger.
Oh that's awesome, have you ever played the classical guitar, steel-string acoustic or jazz string guitar?
I really enjoy the classical! They use nylon stings and it sounds amazing!
I love to play guitar. The six strings and the frets help to make the most beautiful sound.
I don't know much about guitars. My son has one.
Is his an acoustic with a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box, or an electrically amplified guitar?
His is acoustic. 
Someday he might even like to try a jazz guitar that was invented once electric amplification increased the volume of the traditional acoustic guitar.
Sounds like it would have a nice sound.
It does. It is mostly used to play styles of jazz music.
I really think the acoustic has the best sound though. 
Everyone has their favorite. The acoustic guitar's tone  is produced by the strings' vibration and amplified by the hollow body of the guitar which functions as a resonating chamber.
All music is certainly beautiful. 
I play the guitar, do you?
I really want to! They're instruments that are usually 6 stringed.
Yes. I play an hour each day.
Nice! Do you prefer acoustic or electric guitars?
Guitar
Cool! They both sound really different, since they project sound differently.
I prefer acoustic, better sound.
Oh nice, me too! I guess it's the hollow wood that helps.
Yes and do not need an amp.
True, the electric guitar amplifiers are probably really clunky and expensive.
I just learned to play the guitar.  Do you play the guitar?
I do!  I have an electric Guild and an acoustic Seagull.  What do you play?
Well I must be honest, I have not gotten to know the entire family of guitars.  I just began to play using Guitar Hero, the game.
I have a Wii and play Guitar Hero on there as well!  Sometimes it's harder than the actual guitar though
Though the game was first released in 2005, it was not until recently that I became interested.
How many versions are there?
I am not quite sure, however, I know there are few versions that have been released.  I learned with the Classic Rock version.
I have that one and the Aerosmith version.  I have been wanting to get a new one but don't know what else there is
As of late I have been trying to learn songs from the album Bat Out of Hell by Meatloaf. 
That's a good one.  What's your favorite song on that record?
I like playing guitars. how about you?
The guitar is a beautiful instrument. I play a little.
Do you know when it was first created?
Nobody knows for sure, but it had predecessor instruments, as well. Dating before the baroque period.
Wow, what era was that?
The gittern was one of the instruments before the guitar, as well as the vihuela.
How many different types of guitars are their? I know you can get a six string and a 12 string.
There are many. The guitar is a type of chordophone. It has a gut and is made of wood
i like guitar 
Are you referring to the fretted musical instrument?
yes
Well, the sound is projected acoustically so it requires a lot practice to become proficient!
Really?
Yes, it is typically played by strumming or plucking the various strings so you have to be precise
I like the sound of guitar 
Thats because the guitar is a type of chordophone which makes sounds pleasant to the human ear.
Yes it is
I also own a Vivette, which is the four-course Renaissance guitar, its very expensive!
I love playing my guitar and making up new songs, Do you know about the guitar? 
I do. The guitar is an instrument that usually consists of six strings.
Yes and I hear some can have 8 strings. But those are really hard to play, Do you have any favorite guitar songs? 
I have two types of guitars. I have a hollow wooden one for acoustic and I also have an electric one. The electric guitar is my favorite.
Yea my dad used to play the electric guitar, Do you know when they first came out?
Guitars have been around for a really long time. its preceded by the gittern, baroque, and the vihuela.
I bet, I hear people played them in ancient greece, But I am not sure. Did guitars always start out with six strings? 
The instruments I mentioned previously all varied. I also enjoy playing the steel-string guitar. I sometimes play the jazz guitar also.
I hear they use the steel string guitars mostly in country music. 
Steel-string guitars are pretty popular with country musicians but also blues. 
Okay. I play guitar. I can do solos. I play real good. Minor scale. Major scale. Modes. Up and down the fret. All day long.
What inspired you to start playing the guitar? Was there a specific band or music that got you into it?
I wanted t ake the Tom Morello sounds from Rage Against the Machine when I was a kid. I was like "wow! Guitar can make that sound! How can it be!!"
It's really amazing what the best guitarists can do with the instrument. For me it was Guitar Hero the game. I ended up picking up the bass guitar first. 
The bass is a noble insturment. I used to play bass in a band in high school. I was ignorant and tried toplay along with the guitar instead of using a rythym that bolsters the drum beat. I was too arrogant. Do you bolster the drum beat with your playing?
I was taught to play to support the bass drum beat and also balance out the main guitar's melody in between. I think that's what really made it attractive for me. The music sounded so empty without the bass beats. 
Oh wow. You really know your stuff. Who is a cool bass guitar god for you?
Definitely has to be Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
I am looking at buying a guitar. Can you tell me more about them?
Yes absolutely! They are a nice fretted stringed instrument. Usually six strings but you can also get a 12 string.
Ok. I heard there is acoustic and electric. What is the difference?
Well for the acoustic, the body is hallow wood. The electric has an electrical amplifier and played through a speaker.
I think I will go with acoustic so I don't have to buy more equipment. What else can you tell me?
Well it takes some practice. But you can learn to play by strumming or plucking the strings. You can use your thumb and fingernails. In the beginning your fingers will probably get a little sore.
Yeah I heard some people use a plastic "pick" so they don't have to use their fingers.
Yes this is true. They are made of plastic or sometimes wood or even glass.
Wow I will have to decide what is best for me. Thanks for your help getting me started!
No problem. Also there are different types of acoustics. There is the modern acoustic, as well as the classical acoustic which has nylon strings. I love the sound of nylon, but typically it's only used for classical music. 
I started playing the guitar at 13 years old, I took classes in school.
That's cool! Do you play acoustic or electric guitar?
I play both but I prefer acoustic, it feels more real to  me.
The guitar strings always hurt my fingers. I did better with classical nylon strings than steel.
It takes a bit of time to get used to the strings, that's for sure. Do you currently play?
No, I never could get the hang of it or develop the callouses.
How long did you try for?
I guess about a year. How long did it take for you to get good?
how well can you play the guitar?
Not very well! I'm not very well versed in musical notes and playing instruments. With guitars I'm amazed how so many different sounds can come from a hollow wooden wood box!
Would you ever like to learn how to play?
I think if I was to pick up a guitar it would be the electric guitar because of it's stellar sound.
thats is a really good choice, who is your favourite musician
Paul McCartney is my favorite. He is actually an avid guitarist and has played many different kind of guitars such as the bass guitar! Who is your favorite musician? 
post Malone is a current favourite , I like he range of genres
Post Malone is rather interesting I think my favorite song from him is "Too Young" it's very catchy
Have you ever played the guitar, it sounds so beautiful, I would love to learn how to play one
Yes i love playing the guitar, The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box
Oh wow, that is so complex, I figured it was something simple. Are there different types of guitars
Yes, The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings, wich makes them have lots of variaties
I see, so are there other types of chordophones?
There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: the classical guitar (nylon-string guitar), the steel-string acoustic guitar, and the archtop guitar
I think I prefer the acoustic guitar, it seems to have a softer sound than the classical guitar. 
the electric guitar is pretty good too, The vibration occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks, fingerpicks, or taps the strings
I forgot about the electric guitar! No wonder it has such a unique sound. Have people been playing guitars for a long time?
Yes, im pretty sure guitars have ben around for a while 
I've always wanted to learn to play guitar, but I'm quite intimidated by it
It can be especially when you realize that there are 3 types of modern guitars. The classical guitar, the steel-string acoustic guitar, and the arch top guitar
Wow. I had no idea. Do you play each of them differently? 
They have different frets. The classical guitar has 12 frets while the steel string guitar has 14
Oh cool. And what is a fret? 
A fret is raised portion of a stringed instrument. 
Do the three types of guitars make different music? 
They are basically played the same way. When you strum the strings, the vibration is amplified by the body of the guitar which acts as a resonator. 
Hey there! I play guitar, the 3 stringed fretted instrument. Have you ever played?
I have not unfortunately, but it is for sure a instrument I want to learn. Do you play anything else?
No I don't I've dedicated all my creative energy to learning about the guitar. Mine projects sound acoustically and is made of wood. Although I have at times played an electric guitar with an amplifier.
That is cool! Which do you life better, acoustic or electric?
Definitely acoustic. I find it's very nice to play a traditional style instrument. It reminds me of the older guitars throughout history that were made of wood and the string made of gut. Guitars belong to a family of instruments called chordophones.
Acoustic guitars definitely have a more soothing traditional sound to them as well as comforting. I do not know much about the family of instruments but what others are included in chordophones?
It would include all stringed instruments that produce sound by vibrating the strings. Like the banjo, harps, things like that!
Ooo the harp is another instrument that is interesting to me! Just a simple instrument with beautiful sounds. Any others interest you?
Hm... right now my passion is the acoustic guitar. I love the tone amplified by the hollow body of the acoustic guitar. It's like heaven!
Can't argue that! How long have you been playing for?
I love listening to the sounds of the guitar, especially the electric guitar, do you know anything cool about guitars?
I know its a six string fretted instrument and sounds pretty cool
Yeah I think some guitars can have less than six strings actually, like bass guitars sometimes, not positive though.
I love the sound of electric guitar the sound comes through an electric amplifier
Yeah the amp really helps make the sound very loud and intense, and you can use amp settings to customize the sound.
A guitar is a type of chordophone usually made from wood and strung with nylon or steel string
That's interesting, what exactly is a chordophone?
Main guitars are usually classical nylon string, acoustic and the archtop (Jazz) guitar
Right I understand the main types of guitars, but I'd like to know what exactly a chordophone is? Can you tell me?
all guitars are a type of chordophone normally its constructed of wood and strung with nylon or steel strings
I love watching people play guitar. I can't play myself, so it's fascinated to see other people with the skill to play well.
Our modern guitar was preceded by the glittern, a Renaissance guitar.
How does it differ from modern guitars?
Instead of having six strings, it was a four-course instrument.
Only four? Must have been easier to play than six! When did six strings become a thing?
That I am not sure of.
Who invented the guitar anyhow?
I do not know who gets the credit, but the four-course vihuela and the five-course baroque guitar contributed to its development. 
I wonder what types of music were played back when the guitar was first invented. Would you happen to know?
I do not know, but it is presently used in every style of music.
guitar is a cool instrument
It really is. I love that there is more than one type of acoustic guitar, i.e. the classical one, the steel-string one and the archtop. Each has a different sound.
oh yea its so cool
It is. I love the sound of old types of guitar too, like the vihela and the baroque guitar. They are part of the modern day guitar's history.
yea i agree, a good acoustic is amazing
It's funny how it's designed so the hollow body acts almost like an echo chamber, resonating sound when you pluck the strings.
yea its quite impressive design
I think I prefer acoustic guitars to electric ones. The sound is more traditional than hearing it through an electrical amplifier and speaker.
Two things in life I adore. Sleeping and playing the guitar. Wish I could do both at the same time.
That's funny.  I enjoy the guitar myself.  Now, do you use an acoustic guitar, or do you go for the electric guitar with amplification?  
I do it all is there one thats best?
It really is just a matter of preference.  There are basically three types of guitars: the acoustic guitar, the steel-string guitar, and the "jazz" guitar.
I think the acoustic guitar is the most romantic. I like to play that the most. Really trying to get noticed.
I can understand that for sure.  I agree with you.  The tone of the classic guitar is awesome.  The way it sounds through the hollow wood is so pleasing to the ear.  Just beautiful!  
Do you know what the most popular guitar type is?
That may be the "air" guitar.  Everyone I know plays that one!  Ha.  There are actually organized air guitar competitions now.  So, if one can't play it, they can pretend they do!  
I want to play the guitar!
The guitar is fretted an the instrument has six strings.
Is it hard to learn?
The tone of an acoustic guitar is made by vibration of strings witht he body of the guitar being hollow which is a chamber to produce the sound.
Ok so It seems that I would just have to learn how to properly string the strings. Any favourite guitarists?
There are three types of acoustic guitar. The classical guitar the archtop guitar which is also known as jazz guitar. Also the steel string guitar.
Right, and which do you prefer?
a guitar is played by strumming strings or plucking them. You can use thumbs , finger nails or with a pick.
I wish i could learn to play guitar! I own an accoustic guitar and can't plau it
Its not too hard, I love tone a guitar makes, the strings' vibration really make for a good vibe, I learned how to play on a hollow body guitar inside of a resonating chamber.
i love the way it sounds as well! Where did the guitars come from
Well I know that the modern guitar today came out after the gittern called the the vihuela,It was a four-course Renaissance guitar, Which pretty much inspired the modern six-string guitar.
i've never heard of vihuela before! how interesting
Yeah Vihuela's were used from the 15th and 16th century in Spain, Portugal and even in Italy, It also had five or six doubled strings on it like a guitar. 
I wanna see the picture of it. I will google it
Yeah google it and youll be surprised on how closely it looks like a modern day guitar. Is there anything else youd like t o know about guitars?  
Have you ever played the guitar? It is an instrument with six strings.
Yes, I've played since I was a kid. I used it in college to pick up girls. Do you play?
I do not. What type do you play? There are three types such as acoustic, classical, and steel-string.
acoustic mostly. I have a new baby so the steel-string is to loud.
Acoustic is my favorite guitar sound. The tone is from the strings' vibration.
Yes, it relax's my baby. I play her to sleep. 
I bet that is soothing since the sound comes from a wooden box.
I want to learn to play classical but I just don't have enough time.
Hey, do you play or know much about the guitar?
no, i dont play the guitar, tell me about it
Well, a guitar is pretty much a long instrument with six strings. Many radio stars play it in their songs.
yea, i have seen one but i think i will love to learn it, when was it produced?
That's cool, I'm not sure when it was produced, but the tone it makes is produced by the strings vibration. The vibration is amplified by the guitars' hollow body.
ok, so do you play the guitar?
I play it a little bit, I'd really like to learn it more, like you said. Do you play any type of instrument?
yea, i play the drums and i sing pretty well too, but i wish to learn the piano, though i play it little
That's awesome, I like to sing too. Back in high school I was in show choir. I've also tried learning piano, but I'm not any good. What made you get into music?
i went into music because its my passion
That's great, it was nice chatting with you about guitars/music.
I play the guiter ,so you?
No, I don't. But I think those six strings can create some amazing sounds.
Do you know who invented the guitar?
I don't. I know the sound is either acoustic, using hollow wood or plastic, or electric amplifier and and a speaker.
So can you explain the difference beweeen the types 
Well, the modern acoustic has three types, classical guitar which is nylon string, the steel string acoustic and the archtop guitar. 
How about the .other types?
The tone for an acoustic guitar is made by the vibration of the strings, and the hollow body amplifies it, and that acts as a resonating chamber.
Howon
Of course, as you know, a person strums or plucks the strings with a pick, while fretting the strings with the other hand.
I love learning to play the guitar, its a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings
I have a Washburn acoustic but I still don't know how to play.  :(
I have been learning very very slowly, i cant play any songs yet. Its a very difficult instrument to play! 
I downloaded a book that says it will make me a guitar ninja, but the going is slow.
Good luck, i'm sure you'll get there! The tone of an acoustic guitar is made by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber.
I need to re-string my guitar, even though I haven't played much.  I am going to put nylon strings on instead of metal.
Wow thats surprising, what does the nylon strings do? 
They are supposed to sound 'softer' than metal strings.  Maybe it will make me a better player.
I may have to try that when i need to re string my guitar. That's a good idea!
I like the musicians in the subways in NYC, last time I was there a guy was playing guitar and he was fantastic.  I gave him $10.
I own a couple of guitars, but I wish I was better at playing them.  They are fretted instruments that have six strings.
What type of guitars do you have?
One of them is an electric guitar that I have paired up with an amplifier 
That sounds fun,  Do you have an acoustic guitar too?
I do, but I really want a bass guitar.  I want a four string bass, which is the most common.
I would have to agree that the bass guitar is best.  What kind of music do you like to play on it?
I would like to play more Grunge music.  I am a big fan of Soundgarden, Pearl Jame, and Alice in Chains.
Awesome!  My favorite guitarist is Sean Yseul from White Zombie she play the Bass.  Have you hear of her?
SO I have picked up playing the guitar. It has six strings and is a fretted musical instrument.
Are there any variants other than the six string version?
I think Keith Richards plays a 5 string guitar. I have been playing an electric guitar. The sounds is projected through an electrical amplifier.
Do you know when the guitar first gained popularity
There were many different types that preceded the guitar. There was the vihuela, gittern, four-course Renaissance guitar, and baroque guitar.
Are there any types of music that the guitar is particularly popular in?
The guitar is hugely popular with modern rock music. The guitar is played by using your fingers to pluck the strings. 
Are there any other instruments that compliment it well?
Sure. Drums and bass go well. Popular guitars are the steel-string, classical, and the archtop. 
It seems like the guitar has developed a lot over the years.
Different cultures have helped develop the guitar.  The string vibrations help the acoustic guitar produce different tones.
The guitar is my favorite instrument.  It is fretted and normally has six strings
I love the guitar. I used to play classical guitar, but wasn't very good. Do you know where the guitar originated?
Actually guitars evolved from the gittern, the vihuela, and the Renaissance guitar.
So they've been around a while then. I know there are different types of guitar, but don't really know much about them. Any ideas?
Well my personal favorite is Acoustic guitars.  The transmit sound by vibrating the strings and do not use electronic amps
That's what I used to have. I agree with you - they're my favorite, too. What else do you know about guitars? You obviously know more than me!
The guitar is actually considered a type of chordophone, only it is distringuished by its different construction
Hmm. I didn't know there was much difference. Interesting. What is the construction difference?
The different construction using the nylon or steel strings 
Ah, ok. Makes sense. Any other interesting facts about the guitar that I should know?
I've decided to learn to play guitar. Picked up a used acoustic at the pawn shop
i love the guitar, Music is my favorite form of self expression
Historically music is an art form and ingrained into many cultures
I think music is the most impartant thing in life, and the human voice is the most beautiful instrument
It's amazing how our vocal cords can produce not only song, but talk, laughter, crying etc
the voice is the key to humans I believe, what could we do without it?
My wife actually contracted Reinke's edema, which is swelling of the vocal cords
that is terrible, how did it effect her life? how is she now?
She actually needed surgery to remove the "sac" that had developed on her vocal cords
Wow, and everything went smoothly? no complications?
I have played the guitar for 35 years. It is a threaded musical instrument with six strings but is much more than that to a great many people who play.
Tell me more about that, I dont play nothing.
I play both acoustic guitar which is an instrument that's basically a hollow wooden box and I also play electric guitar which is basically a slab of wood with pick ups that turn the strings movement into electrical signals.
That is amzing, I wish you were her to play for me. i would love to hear that.
One of my favorite musicians is Robert Smith he led the band called the Cure throughout the late 70s and early 80s. He has a very distinct voice and unique stage look.
I have never heard of him actually. I normally just listen to whatever is trending.
 you may have heard the music in the recent movie AntMan. When they were fighting in the suitcase a track from the album "disintegration" was playing. This was one of their last album is a 1989.
i like ant man, but the other marvels are for sure my favorite.
I thought Paul Rudd was really good in that movie and Michael Pena was really funny. I am more partial to Iron Man and Captain America though. Black Panther was really good too I just saw it.
I agree with you in all of this information.
How does an electric guitar work?  How does it pick up the sounds from the strings?
An electric guitar is a guitar that uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, i used to be really good at it
Did you only play electric, or did you play an acoustic guitar as well?
both but really enjoyed the electric more, The pickup used to sense the vibration generally uses electromagnetic induction to do so
How does moving one finger along the neck of the guitar, change the pitch of the string?
the pressure on the string changes making the sound different
Were you good enough to tune a guitar by ear, or did you need a tuner?
for a time i learned to do it by ear, The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration
Do you know how to play the guitar? I just learned last year, and it's really fun!
How do you play?
Well, you play a guitar by strumming/plucking the strings, usually with your fingers or a pick. This is what creates the sound.
How long did it take you to learn?
It took me a few months to be able to play simple songs, but I'm sure with more practice I'll only keep getting better! Do you play any instruments?
I like to play the drums.
How cool! I used to play marching drums in high school! I had to wear a harness to keep the drum in front of me!
How long did you play the drums?
For all four years I was in Marching Band. We went to competitions and performed for hundreds of people!
Did it make you nervous?
Guitars are really cool instruments and usually have 6 strings.
did you ever played guiters?
Nah I've never played the guitar, but I want to learn to play an instrument at some point.
i love played guitar, the music gives me a plesant sound
Acoustic or electric guitar? They both produce different sounds.
i never played electric guitar just once i played the acoustic guitar.
That's cool, the acoustic produces sound with a hollow wooden or plastic box.
i used the hollow wooden to play, and i have practiced with that in a music class.
Did you strum with your finger, thumb, or nail?
at first with the card then i used with the thumb 
Do you play acoustic or electric guitar?
I actually do not play either one.
Would you like to learn to play the guitar?
I would love to. Can you teach me?
Im sure you know the basics of plucking the strings with your fingers or often a pick.
I mean I have attempted it. But no success.
Each of your fingers has a label on the guitar. Index = i, middle = m, ring = a, and thumb = p. This helps in reading music and playing songs.
Ok. Kinda like a typewriter...
I don't know a lot about type writers, but, I am sure you are correct.
well I don't know much about guitars but you seem to know your stuff!!!
I was in a band in college where I played the guitar.  It's my favorite instrument
Do you play the guitar.  My niece was learning how to play.  She was playing pretty good too.  The sound is a nice acoustic mix
I started by playing the acoustic, but my uncle gave me an electric so I play both now
What do you prefer?  she is pretty good at plucking the strings and strumming and just coming up with her own tunes
I personally prefer the electric.  I have a vintage Guild and the sound is incredible
wow thats really neat.  I read that the modern guitar was preceded by something called the gittern, the vihuela, the four course Renaissance guitar, and the five course baroque guitar
That's so cool!  I've never heard of those.  I wonder how they differ from the guitars we know now?
It said that they all contributed in some way to the modern 6 string instrument we have today
Do you know what year the original gittern was invented?
I have read that it was represented in the 13th century in western Europe
I wish I could play the guitar.
If only I can see you in person, I can tell you more about how to play the guitar.  You play it by strumming or plucking the strings with your fingers while pressing against the frets on your other hand.
It sure sounds like it requires a lot of coordination.
It does take some practice - there are usually six strings that you need to press against the frets to make various chords and when you combine enough of these chords together, you get a song.
Are there many different types of guitars?
Yes - there's a lot of different variations of guitars.  For example, a bass guitar has a similar appearance but only has four to six strings and longer neck.  It sounds totally different as well.
Is one easier to play than the other? Or does the number strings not make that much difference?
The more strings there are, the harder it would be to play as your hand would need to be stretched out more.  With that said, there is also the electric guitar, which is similar to the guitar but uses pickups to convert the sound of the strings into electrical signals.
I bet learning the guitar would open up more new skills, with all the coordination!
Sure thing - you can be a music teacher or a guitar player in a band.  All the famous guitarist you probably know are amazing electrical guitar players.  The cool thing about electric guitars is that you can alter the sound of the signal and change the timbre of the sound.
I love knowing that there are three main types of modern acoustic guitar.
Can you tell me more about that?
I would be happy to, they are: the classical (nylon strings), the steel-string acoustic guitar, and the archtop guitar which is sometimes called a  jazz guitar.
That is amazing, I think my girlfriend actually owns one of those.
I have tried to play the guitar but right now I'm focusing on another stringed instrument: The Ukulele. 
I can not play anything, but I do love to hear people play. It's the best thing ever.
I agree, music technology is at an amazing level right now and there are great things to listen to.
Music is not only the gateway to the soul. I think music is the soul. It truly is magical. Just like disneyworld at christmas.
Oh! I would love to experience disney world at christmas! (or anytime for that matter).
Disney world is amazing, i think we are going right before christmas this year and I truly can not wait.
I love playing my fretted musical, six string instrument! If you don't know what that is, well it's the guitar of course!
I had no idea i might have to look at getting one are they easy to learn ?
That all depends on a lot of factors, one including the type of guitar. The three main types are the classical guitar which uses nylon-string, the steel-string acoustic guitar and the archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar".
Very interesting information .  Is there anything else that you can tell me about fretted muscial ?
It is typically played by strumming the strings with your fingers, thumb or even fingernails. Sometimes people use a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets). That's where the term fretting instrument comes in.
Oh i see i was wondering what that word meant. Anything else you can tell me ?
Guitars are a type of chordophone which were traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or even steel strings and then distinguished from other similar instruments by its construction and tuning.
Oh wow so we have come a long way since that time.  Very interesting information 
And before the six string guitar that we have today, it was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar and the five-course baroque guitar. All of which contributed to the development of what we see today.
Oh wow thats very nice .  I might have to look more into this 
I have always wanted to learn to play the guitar. Do you know much about guitars?
I know a little. My younger brother can really play an electric guitar.
Is that the guitar you plug into a speaker?
Yep. The speaker you plug the guitar into is generally called an amplifier.
Oh. I suppose it is expensive to buy all of the equipment.
It really is. Especially if you get a big tube amplifier with 12" speakers.
Maybe I should stick with the traditional guitar. It might be easier to afford.
You could always go with a Fender Esquire. It is their budget brand of guitar. Basically it is a cheap version of their flagship stratocaster at one tenth the price.
I always thought guitars were pretty fascinating, do you know when they were created?
Sadly, I do not. But I do know that guitars are typically instruments that have six strings.
Well, duh! Do you have any favorite guitarists? My favorite is Jimi Hendrix!
Jimi Hendrix is friggin awesome! I would say my favorite guitarist, or bassist, is the one that performed with Hendrix, Billy Cox.
He's is definitely pretty good with the guitar too! Do you know any other cool facts about guitars?
Why yes, I do know that the sound of a guitar is either projected acoustically through hollowed out wood or plastic. Or it is projected using an amplifier.
Oh yes, I prefer electric guitars though. Those guitars are more cool looking and louder!
I do too! They are quite prevalent in the music genre Garage rock, also called 60's punk rock.
Although, I won't lie the wooden/plastic guitars have more history behind them. Are guitars related to violins in anyway?
Not much, other than that both are wooden instruments that use strings to generate music.
Guitars are great instruments!
guitars are super cool, very simple too.
They really are. They usually have 6 strings.
oh yea and hollow bodies?
The hollow body means more on the acoustic guitar than the electric.
oh yea that makes sense since you need to reverb from an acoustic
Yeah, most of the sound from the electric guitar is from the amplifier. 
electric guitars are very intense
They are great though, I used to have an electric guitar and amplifier before.
yea i was bad at playing it tho.
I would love to learn to play the guitar. Do you know much about it?
I don't really know much about the guitar. I know that it usually has six strings. I feel like the guitar would be hard to learn.
It sounds so beautiful when it is played for soft ballads.
I agree with you. I love songs that are sung acoustically on the guitar.
Some of the more recent ones, like "Dear Hate" in country music are beautiful on guitar.
I've never heard of that one. Bob Dylan has been influencing music for over five decades with his guitar playing.
He definitely is talented. What are some of his songs?
Some of his best songs are older. I like "Blowin" and "The Times They Are a-Changin". Do you know either of those songs?
I recognize those. They are classics.
"Blowin" has often been described a a protest song.
Are you a fan of the guitar? Conventionally, they have 6 strings.
Yes! I own a Yamaha guitar but it's been so difficult to self learn. Do you know when the first guitar was invented? 
I'm not so sure, but it usually has a hollow wooden or plastic casing.
Yeah, they produce such a nice sound! Do you know how many variants you can get of the guitar?
It is a type of chordophone, for what that's worth. Some have guts and can tune.
That's interesting, i didn't know that. What else can you tell me about the guitar? 
The tone is created by the vibration of the string.
Wow, those vibrations make good music! Do you know what the string can be made out of? 
Some of them are made of nylon now! Others are made of steel.
I might have to switch my steel for nylon since it hurts my fingers haha! Thanks for the information! you're very knowledgeable :)
I love playing guitar in my spare time
it is the best fretted instrument there is
Do you prefer acoustic or electric?
well the sound is different for both are different, for acustic it uses a wooden hollow hole for sound, thats what I prefer
I wonder what other instruments are similar to a guitar
well there are different types of guitars, of course electric, acustic, but there are also classical guitars, and steel-string guitar
Which kind came first?
technically the Lute was the first guitar type instrument
I love playing my guitar. It's my favorite fretted instrument.
I love guitar music too. I used to play classical guitar years ago.
It's just so much fun to strum and pick away at it for hours.
Yes, it is. It takes a lot of practice to be good, mind you. That was my downfall - not enough practice.
Did you play and acoustic guitar, or an electric guitar?
Acoustic. My parents bought it for me as a gift and arranged for guitar lessons from a very good guitarist. It was such fun!
I really enjoy the tone of an acoustic guitars. The way it resonates is so soothing.
Very soothing. Playing guitar can be a very relaxing thing to do - I may have to take it up again.
I love guitar music -- everything from classical to acoustic rock. How about you?
I love it too!  The sound of a fretted instrument with six strings is amazing!
Obviously it's been around for a long time...I wonder *how* far back it dates as an instrument?
I really don't know! But I do know that a guitar is usually made from wood
And different kinds - I imagine that different woods might give a different sound. That would be interesting to know -- what different guitarists prefer when it comes to the main material.
An acoustic guitar is something awesome!  Especially one with steel strings
I do love acoustic. A favorite album is Skin and Bones by the Foo Fighters -- lots of their most popular songs, stripped down. Beautiful!
Yes, the acoustic guitar makes lovely music!  It has a bright, loud sound
I wish I knew how to play guitar
I have never learned either. Guitars are fretted instruments usually with six strings.
I just love the sound
Me too. Classic guitars produce sound from a hollow cavity in the guitar body.
Electric guitars sound pretty cool, but I would want a classic
Yeah, they sound better to me as well. They are played by strumming and plucking the strings with your fingers, or using a pick.
It seems like it would be difficult to learn
I think you're right, at least until you get the hang of it. The tone is produced by the string vibration, amplified by the body of the guitar.
hey do you know much about guitar, ive been wanting to learn more.
The main thing I know about guitars is that they have 6 strings.
do you know how long theyve been used? when were they first used/invented?
I actually don't know much about the history, but I do know the sound is projected with the acoustics from the wooden body.
thats interesting, are there other types of guitars besides acoustic?
There are steel-string, classical, and jazz guitars.
wow well thanks for all the info on guitars.
Do you want to know about electric guitars? They convert the vibration of the strings into signals of electricity.
Do I sound narcissistic to say, I am the best guitar player in the world? I am. Only... I'm sad I don't know anything about guitars, except how to naturally play great. Do you? 
Yo do not sound narcissistic it is ok to not know stuff,  The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box.
I should of guessed that! I'm feeling smarter already lol, thank you. Please say you know more. Put some facts behind my talent 
Hahahah of course, The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel,
See, the gut and steel I knew, but the nylon was a surprise for me. I'm writing this down, what else ya know?
There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: the classical guitar, the steel guitar and the archtop guitar
That's what I've been rocking, it's the modern acoustic guitar. I want an archtop
Yeah in really like playing the electric guitar it is my favorite thing in the world .
I would love to learn how to play a guitar but i know nothing about guitars
It is a simple fretted instrument that has 6 strings normally
Cool! Do you know when the guitar was invented?
The modern guitar came from the old style gittern, vihuela, and a baroque guitar
I don't think i've ever heard about those instruments
The gittern was a small instrument that was around during the 13th century Europe
what about vihuela?
It was similar to a guitar and was found in 15th and 16th century Spain, Portugal and Italy.  It had 5-6 doubled strings
That's really interesting
There is also the mandolin which is similar to a lute and has 8 strings
I was thinking of learning the guitar, do you know much about the guitar in general?
Indeed I do. It's a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings.
Interesting, do you know when the guitar was originally invented?
Well they cannot be traced back anytime before the 15th century.
Wow it's been around for a while then probably. Are there different types of guitars?
There are acoustic guitars as well as electric guitars.
Can you explain the difference?
Acoustic guitars produce sound using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box, while the electric guitar uses a electrical amplifier and a speaker.
So, do you play guitar professionally? Are you in any sort of band?
No, but my boyfriend plays guitar. He tried to teach me, but that six strings, it would be easier with one. 
Ah, alright. What kind of songs do you like to play in your free time?
Rock music, Something from Scorpions, or Aerosmith, it sounds great on acoustic guitar, I like vibrations. 
That's pretty cool. Would you ever want to go professional one day, or do you just enjoy it as a hobby?
No, I am not for that, it's just hobby. Do you like rock music?
Yeah, mostly classic stuff like The Beatles, Queen, that sort of thing. Do you have a favourite song?
Still loving you from Scorpions. I like Art Rock too. Influences is drawn from experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.
I just love to play the guitar.  My favorite is the electric guitar.
Me too! I love the fretted six stringed instrument. Do you have a favorite type of music?
I personally love rock music.  Do you know what instruments are predominant in rock music? 
Rock music that originated in the US in the early 1950s used predominantly electric guitars!  
My favorite instrument in rock music is the drums.  
Right! Yeah it's nice but very loud. My friend went almost deaf from playing too much. It's so nice though to play the collection of cymbals and percussion instruments with sticks. 
It takes a lot of work to be a drummer.  Working that bass petal really hurts your legs.
Yeah! Do you ever use the double bass? What about woodblocks and cowbells?
I really like the guitar, I used to play it when I was in college, Have you tried playing the guitar?
no, i'm more a piano person but my husband has an accoustic six strings guitar
A six string guitar is what I had in college actually, I remember playing many songs for my room-mates, I'm curious who makes the majority of guitars in the US anyways? 
i think Gibson company makes guitars. The modern guitar was preceeded by the gittern, the vihuela and the four course guitar
Those sounds like interesting instruments, What is a gittern?, I never heard of it
gittern was a relatively small gut strung round backed instrument 
Oh ok, it sounds very traditional. I wonder what countries it was popular in. Do you know? 
yes, it was popular during 13th century in western europe. Italy, france, England
Oh wow so it definitely has some history to it. Ill have to look it up. 
you mentioned you used to play guitar. what type? there is a classical guitar, acoustic guitar, the archtop guitar
I love the guitar do you play it?
Sure do! I've been teaching myself how to play acoustic guitar, and I think someday I might also wanna learn jazz guitar!
I have heard most rock has jazz notes in it
Yeah I guess you could say that guitar solos are heavy on the polyrhythms and improvisation, so in a way they could be considered jazzy.
Do you have any songs you want to learn?
I'd have to say I want to learn most of the Johnny Cash discography at least right now, then move on to The Flashbulb.
I have never heard of that before
Well I assume you don't mean you've never heard of Johnny Cash, because he's one of the best-selling musical artists EVER.
Is he the guy that wrote that Hurt song?
Yes indeed, and songs from a lot of other genres too. Blues, folk, gospel if you like it. He did them all.
I've always wanted to learn how to play the guitar, which is an instrument that has usually has 6 fixed strings on it.
What a great instrument -- and so versatile. Is there a certain kind of guitar or guitar music you want to play?
Not really, just the idea of it is really interesting. Especially how they are either electric or acoustic.
I guess acoustic would lend itself to more flexibility. It would be great to be able to just pick up something like that and make beautiful music! Do you have a favorite musician?
There's too many for me to have a real favorite. The difference between the two different types of guitars is how the sound is projected, which I found really fascinating. 
Very true. And I do like a variety of music. Do you prefer electric or acoustic? Or just depends?
I like acoustic more for the most part, as I like how the hollow wood sounds compared to the electric amp.
I do too. Hearing the Foo Fighters go acoustic on Skin + Bones made me fall for the music harder than had I just heard the electric versions of the songs.
Also the different types of strings make it sound different, as they can be made of gut, nylon, or steel.
I love how musicians can tell the nuances that every part of a guitar will bring to their music -- strings, body style, material -- it's like finding true love ;-)
I play a lot of guitar but I think I sleep just as much. They're my two favorite hobbies.
I never playyed guitar but I sure know how to sleep.
I really like Nothing Records. It's an American record label, they specialize in industrial rock and electronic music. It's my favorite kinds of music.
I am not up to speed on that type of music. Interesting.
Industrial music is electronic music genre, consisting of harsh , transgressive or kind of provocative sounds.
Sounds like I should maybe check it out. I might like it. I like all types of music.
There is for example industrial metal, like Ministry, Godflesh, KMFDM or Rammstein.
Interesting names for the bands. Sounds insane.
Haha, kind of. It developed in the late 1980s and then became to fuse into common genre.
I will look into it. I think I will jam it when I am getting ready to go out at night.
I love the guitar. 
I do too but I can't play, so I pretend to play on guitar hero the game. It mimics the features of playing a real guitar. 
Yes.  I have played the guitar hero.  I don't know how play well on that either.  Do you know anything about different types of guitars?
I know that most guitars usually have about six strings to them. 
Yes; but are their not different types like a classical guitar, and an electric guitar?  That sort of thing?
Yeah classical guitars have a wooden frame around them and are considered acoustic. 
How about electric guitars?  Those are my favorite.  What can you tell me about them?
Its pretty much just like a classical guitar but has electric pickups that convert the vibration of the the strings into electrical signals that are played through an amp to make music. 
That is cool.  I love to hear both the classical and electric guitars played.  Each one has their own special sound to them.  Do you know any famous guitar players, or have a favorite guitarist that you listen to?
Eric clapton is one of my favorites, he was a blues guitarist back in the day. 
I love to play the guitar.  It is described as a fretted instrument with six strings.  Do you play?
I don't but would love to if you convince me about it :)
Its great to unwind and relax and play a few tunes, especially with friends round.  There are 3 main types, the acoustic guitar, the steel-string and the archtop.  I have just about masted the steel string so far.
Amazing, do you know the history of when they started using it?
the oldest guitar is around 3500 years old! The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, then the vihuela and before that the four course renaissance guitar.
Nice, what types of guitars are out there?
Well I think the coolest are the electric guitars.  They use one or more pickups to convert the string vibrations into electric signals.  examples are The Fender Stratocaster or The Gibson Les Paul
Amazing information. How much do you think it would cost to buy one?
You can pick up a cheap guitar for 40 dollars but for the The Fender Stratocaster you can be talking 1500 dollars or more!!
the guitar is a great musical instrument
Yeah I love the way it sounds.
its either a hollow wooden body or uses an amplifier
They both sound so different since one is acoustic and one is electric.
yea, guitars usually only have 6 strings
That makes sense, same with stuff like the bass.
you play it by plucking the strings with a pick
Can't you just use your fingers too?
yea fingers, thumbs, or fingernails all work
Hmm that's interesting!
Hey, I play guitar. Do you play?
I do.  Not well.  It is a fretted intrument with six strings
Yes I know. I have an acoustic guitar. It's made of mahogany. 
What kind of guitar to you have?  I have always liked the Gibson Hummingbird.  It is their first square shoulder dreadnought
Wow, yeah that's a nice one. I have a Washburn guitar.
Nice.  They have been around a long time.  Since 1883 and were based out of Chicago.
Really? I had no idea they were so old. Do you know how old guitars have been around for?
I really do not.  I know it originated from something called the gittern
My friend plays the guitar, do you know much about guitars?
Not much,  but I know a few things.  For example, I know the guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel string.
That's interesting, what exactly is a chordophone?
A chordophone is a musical instrument that makes sound by way of a vibrating string stretched between two points.
That makes sense, do you know when the guitar was invented?
Not exactly, but the modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance and the five-course baroque guitar.
Wow it sounds like it has quite the history, what exactly is a gittern?
A guittern was a small gut instrument that first appears in literature during 13th century in Western Europe.
Fascinating, do you know anything cool about the electric guitar?
Well an electric guitar uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its string into electrical signals.
I would love to learn how to play the guitar.
Oh yeah? You mean the fretted musical instrument that has six strings?
Yes. I love the sound of it.
Yeah, the sound is projected acoustically using a hollow wooden or plastic box. That is what makes the sound so nice!
I prefer the acoustic guitar sound.
Me too. :) If you know how to play than you know that it is played by strumming or plucking the strings with your fingers, thumb or fingernails. using the right hand. The left hand is for pressing the strings.
I know that part, but I do not know how to play music.
Which style do you like best? there are 3 types of modern acoustic guitar. The classical guitar, the steel string guitar or the jazz guitar?
Probably the classic guitar would be my favorite.
Yeah me too! It just has a wonderful vibration that is amplified by the hollow body of the guitar.
Do you know how to play the guitar? My father used to play but i've never picked it up.
I do play a little but nothing major. I get a bit lost with the 6 strings and the frets. 
Did you ever take lessons or just pick it up on your own?
I had classes for a few months but my teacher lost me when he tried to explain how each freat is a semitone in the standard western system and that an octave has twelve semitones.
well, you know more than I do. I don't even know what a semitone is.
A semitone is a half tone and is called the most dissonant when sounded harmonically. It's a bit complicated I would say but it's common in Western tonal music.
I'm not sure what that means but I will take your word for it. Do you have a favorite guitarist? I personally enjoy listening to Slash from Guns and Roses.
Yes I do like Guns 'n' Roses. Axl Rose also sings for AC/DC since 2016  and I do enjoy them!
I didn't know that. I sort of thought he disappeared after the last Guns and Roses album in 2008
Yes those bands rarely tour nowadays and AC/DC lost their lead singer after a heavy night of alcohol consumption in 1980 but still kept going!
Hi, I play the guitar do you?
I can't really play a guitar all that well but my brother is a wizz with his six string.
That's cool.  It took me awhile to learn myself.  Do you still practice?
No not really. I have a classical guitar sitting around somewhere, but I can hardly play it.
Do you play any other instruments?
I played a recorder in music class back in middle school! I could barely use it as much more than a whistle.
I started playing the violin myself recently, are there any instrumrnts you'd like to learn?
I often dreamed of learning to play the violin actually. But I just don't have talent with stringed instruments.
I love people that play guitar, don't really know how to play it. It is a fretted musical instrument
I have never played either.  What does fretted mean?
It means fragile instrument, it is also an instrument that has six strings
Interesting.  I guess it is fragile.  When were guitars created?
I don't really know but I know thatmodern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar 
I have never heard of those instruments.  Do they all look similar?
Somehow, there is one that is traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones 
What do you mean by gut?
I love the sound of a guitar riff coming thru a huge amplifier. Wouldnt you agree?
Yeah same. The fretted instrument with six strings sounds nice. It looks very hard. I'm currently learning piano.
I know how to play a few songs on a guitar. Mainly Nirvana and Metallica. Whos your favorite guitarists?
Oh nice. I was actually just listening to nothing else matters by tthe american heavy medal band. I also like nirvanna. I
Nothing Else Matters has some amazing guitar riffs.
Yeah it really does. I honestly listen to like almost every genre, but haven't like heavily explored rock enough to be honest. I like The unforgiven and where i may roam and sad but true among others a lot.
The Master of Puppets is a must listen to if your exploring Metallica. I love their gutarists Gibson guitar.
Ok ok. I think I've heard it but i'll give a re listen. It sais its the third studio album from Metallica. Do you lke other rock besides  metal?
