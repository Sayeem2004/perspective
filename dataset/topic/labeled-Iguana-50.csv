That's sweet. What does he eat?
do you know how long will they live? I may die before they do :)
they are not that scary, but calm and relaxed creatures. Just like the novel series The "Warriors" depicts calm people as scary
true. by the way, the scales behind their necks are known as tuberculate scales
Haha.. i think you know they vary greatly in length
They would make a cool pet.  What Kind of Iguana do you want?
Iguanas can live up to 20 years if they are cared for properly
Iguanas range in length including the tail. Some males can get over 5ft in length
I don't know anything about lesser antilles iguana! Can you tell me more?
actually these are not that big, they are sort of babies so I do not know how big they will get
Yeah in the wild im sure they hunt small rodents as well. The come from south America and the carribbean
I had no idea. My neighbors have one and is like a teal color
Two species are included in the genus "Iguana": the green iguana, which is widespread throughout its range and a popular pet, and the Lesser Antillean iguana
Are Iguanas good pets? They sound pretty easy to care for.
I love learning about other cultures and I will definitely look for more info about them
iguana are quite cool but can be annoying little guys when you get a lot of them
That is cool! Is it expensive? I know they range in  lengths, including their tail
Iguanas have a dewlap, which is a spine and OMG a tiny 3rd eye on their heads! Creepy!
He wasn't super long. Maybe a couple of feet. Kinda a little guy as iguanas go.
I used to have a pet iguana! They can be a lot of fun.
Well for one they can range in length, including their tails.  The name was derived from the Taino name "Iwana".
Wow at the top so they actually don't need that one most likely, what kind of things do they feed off of? 
Whoa! I can't imagine! And they are herbivorous, so no meat? I wonder what their favorite thing to eat is. 
That's cool. Those spikes look awesome. They seem like pretty docile creatures.
Yes, they are.  Blues can live the longest of any iguana, up to 69 years....talk about a lifetime pet.
I have not heard of that before. tell me more about Iguanas please
Do you like the genus of herbivorous lizards from tropical mexico and central america known as the iguana?
Actually, there are just two. The green iguana is the popular pet. The other one in the Antilles is endangered because of habitat destructions.
So, what's the difference?
There are two species of "Iguana" the green iguana and the lesser antillaean Iguana
An iguana is an herbivorous lizard. Only plants!
Usually about 12 years. The small scale behind the iguanas ears that look like spokes are called tuberculate scales.
That's interesting. Does it help them see in the dark?
Do they really slap their tails when they  feel threatened?
I think so. Mostly in South America and Central America
I agree, they definitely have a prehistoric look to them. There are also over 6000 species spread across the world.
Well, you have to be careful. Diet, lighting, and other housing for a green iguana like mine causes too many to die in captivity too soon.
My Iguanas have teeth but they have never bitten me. I don't think it would hurt terribly because mine are small. Iguanas can vary in length though.
I own a pet iguana, its a genus of herbivorous lizards that are native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, do you like iguanas?
It is on the top of the head
That is correct they are herbivorous lizards. They like all kinds of greens such as kale and lettuce.
I've never heard of that television drama. What is it about?
i know :D most species of parrot can make excellent companions, the best ones are those who can mimic talk :D
What sets Iguanas apart from other reptiles like Lizard?
Wow! Parrots live for about that long too don't they?
You want the blue one trust me.  What freaks me out about Iguanas are those spines running down their back and that third eye on their heads.
The genus was first described in 1768
They have a third eye, so it would be bad if they weren't.
Does he change colors?
no iguanas are lizards so they are herbivores
