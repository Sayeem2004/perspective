That's sweet. What does he eat?	F
do you know how long will they live? I may die before they do :)	F
they are not that scary, but calm and relaxed creatures. Just like the novel series The "Warriors" depicts calm people as scary	F
true. by the way, the scales behind their necks are known as tuberculate scales	F
Haha.. i think you know they vary greatly in length	F
They would make a cool pet.  What Kind of Iguana do you want?	F
Iguanas can live up to 20 years if they are cared for properly	F
Iguanas range in length including the tail. Some males can get over 5ft in length	F
I don't know anything about lesser antilles iguana! Can you tell me more?	F
actually these are not that big, they are sort of babies so I do not know how big they will get	F
Yeah in the wild im sure they hunt small rodents as well. The come from south America and the carribbean	F
I had no idea. My neighbors have one and is like a teal color	F
Two species are included in the genus "Iguana": the green iguana, which is widespread throughout its range and a popular pet, and the Lesser Antillean iguana	F
Are Iguanas good pets? They sound pretty easy to care for.	F
I love learning about other cultures and I will definitely look for more info about them	F
iguana are quite cool but can be annoying little guys when you get a lot of them	F
That is cool! Is it expensive? I know they range in  lengths, including their tail	F
Iguanas have a dewlap, which is a spine and OMG a tiny 3rd eye on their heads! Creepy!	F
He wasn't super long. Maybe a couple of feet. Kinda a little guy as iguanas go.	F
I used to have a pet iguana! They can be a lot of fun.	F
Well for one they can range in length, including their tails.  The name was derived from the Taino name "Iwana".	F
Wow at the top so they actually don't need that one most likely, what kind of things do they feed off of? 	F
Whoa! I can't imagine! And they are herbivorous, so no meat? I wonder what their favorite thing to eat is. 	F
That's cool. Those spikes look awesome. They seem like pretty docile creatures.	F
Yes, they are.  Blues can live the longest of any iguana, up to 69 years....talk about a lifetime pet.	F
I have not heard of that before. tell me more about Iguanas please	F
Do you like the genus of herbivorous lizards from tropical mexico and central america known as the iguana?	F
Actually, there are just two. The green iguana is the popular pet. The other one in the Antilles is endangered because of habitat destructions.	F
So, what's the difference?	F
There are two species of "Iguana" the green iguana and the lesser antillaean Iguana	F
An iguana is an herbivorous lizard. Only plants!	F
Usually about 12 years. The small scale behind the iguanas ears that look like spokes are called tuberculate scales.	F
That's interesting. Does it help them see in the dark?	F
Do they really slap their tails when they  feel threatened?	F
I think so. Mostly in South America and Central America	F
I agree, they definitely have a prehistoric look to them. There are also over 6000 species spread across the world.	F
Well, you have to be careful. Diet, lighting, and other housing for a green iguana like mine causes too many to die in captivity too soon.	T
My Iguanas have teeth but they have never bitten me. I don't think it would hurt terribly because mine are small. Iguanas can vary in length though.	F
I own a pet iguana, its a genus of herbivorous lizards that are native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, do you like iguanas?	F
It is on the top of the head	F
That is correct they are herbivorous lizards. They like all kinds of greens such as kale and lettuce.	F
I've never heard of that television drama. What is it about?	F
i know :D most species of parrot can make excellent companions, the best ones are those who can mimic talk :D	F
What sets Iguanas apart from other reptiles like Lizard?	F
Wow! Parrots live for about that long too don't they?	F
You want the blue one trust me.  What freaks me out about Iguanas are those spines running down their back and that third eye on their heads.	F
The genus was first described in 1768	F
They have a third eye, so it would be bad if they weren't.	T
Does he change colors?	F
no iguanas are lizards so they are herbivores	F
