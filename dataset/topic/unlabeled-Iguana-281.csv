I think iguanas are so strang looking. They have rough skin and large eyes
Yes they have a row of spines down their back and a tiny third eye on their head.  Its odd!
I did not know about the third eye of iguanas. That is so weird!
Yes the green iguana is the most common - it is the one usually kept as a pet
I have seen several of iguana that were being kept as pets. They seem to just sit there all day.
Iguanas can live up to 20 years if they are cared for properly
Wow, that is so much better than the life expectancy of a hamster!
Most of the time though the diet and lighting and other conditions for iguanas in captivity are inadequate and they die within the first year :-(
Hi, I have few pet Iguanas. Do you?
No but iguanas are cool cold blooded lizards
I see, does that mean they are reptiles?
Yep iguanas are lizards so they are also reptiles
Yea that makes sense. What else do you know about Iguanas?
its cool also since The genus was first described in 1768 
That was a long time ago. Are iguanas aggressive?
no iguanas are lizards so they are herbivores
Great! I hope to have more Iguanas as pets since they are herbivores
There are also two genus, green and Antillean iguana
I own a pet iguana, its a genus of herbivorous lizards that are native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, do you like iguanas?
I used to have a pet iguana! They can be a lot of fun.
Yes i had a big one, iguanas can range from in length, including their tail
I only fed my iguana fruits and vegetables. I heard that was better if you liked to handle them.
Me too, i had a blue iguana its one of the longest-living species of lizard, they live up to 70 years!
Wow! Parrots live for about that long too don't they?
Yes but there are roughly 393 species of parrots, so it can vary, they are native to in tropical and subtropical regions.
Oh of course. I guess I'm just thinking about common pet parrots like amazons and african greys.
i know :D most species of parrot can make excellent companions, the best ones are those who can mimic talk :D
I had an amazon parrot too. Alas... she only lived to be 35 due to heart disease. 
I love iguanas. They are cool little creatures.
They are indeed!  They range in length, including their tail!  I had one when I was a child!
Was a it a good pet or cause lots of trouble taking care of? Was it nice or try to bite you and other people?
I thought it was a good pet, and it never tried to bite me!  I liked that it had small scales behind its neck that looked like spokes!
That's cool. Those spikes look awesome. They seem like pretty docile creatures.
Well, they don't stir up much trouble, unless they get loose and you can't find them!  LOL  And those spokes are called tuberculate scales!
Do they behave well with regards to potty control. I can imagine them peeing everywhere.
I don't know - I made my little brother clean up after it!  It's interesting that they are native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean.
That wasn't fair. Cleaning up iguana poop must stink. What did their diet consist of?
They like vegetables!  My iguana was blue and the blue ones are one of the longest-living species of lizard 
Have you heard of the iguana? I think I want one as a pet.
Iguanas are popular pets in some areas. I have seen them on leashes
I see, do you have one?
No, I don't. But there areplenty wild ones in the neighborhood because they are native to tropical areas in the Caribbean
How many different species of iguana are there?
Actually, there are just two. The green iguana is the popular pet. The other one in the Antilles is endangered because of habitat destructions.
Oh we should do something to save the Antilles from extinction! 
Yes, we should.  The word iguana comes from the Taino name for the species, "Iwana."
That makes sense. Are Iguanas aggressive or passive?
Actually, they are passive. They have a light sensing organ on top of the head which can see light but not details.  So they do not see very well.
I want to get an iguana so bad!
Do you mean the herbivorous lizards that are common to Mexico and Central America?
yes! They are so cute 
Would you rather have a green Iguana, or a Lesser Antilles Iguana?
I don't know anything about lesser antilles iguana! Can you tell me more?
You want the blue one trust me.  What freaks me out about Iguanas are those spines running down their back and that third eye on their heads.
I think it's kind of cute :) What do iguanas eat?
Plants.  But you don't want an Iguana because they typically die in captivity.
i have a few pet iguanas i just got
Wow!  Those animals are amazing!  I have seen a few in the Caribbean.  I think I would have to get used to having something that big in MY yard!
actually these are not that big, they are sort of babies so I do not know how big they will get
Are they green iguanas?
yes, they are sort of greenish
The Green Iguana has become pretty popular in the United States in the last 20 years.  
I am a real novice, where do they originally come from?
They're native to Central America, South America, and the Caribbean, but have "traveled" to live in other areas.
do you know how long will they live? I may die before they do :)
I heard that they are hard to maintain but can live up to 20 years!
Some day I want to get a pet iguana
That would be cool! The word Iguana is actually from the original name Taino, meaning iwana
I had no idea. My neighbors have one and is like a teal color
That is really cool! Iguana are actually lizards that live in areas of Mexico and Central America
yes!  they like the heat.  Which is why they need heat lamps when you own one.  
That is cool! Is it expensive? I know they range in  lengths, including their tail
Im not sure.  Maybe around $100.  Maybe more if they are young.  
Thats cool! I do know that behind their necks are small scales known as tubercular scales
Iguanas are native to the tropics of the Americas
I have not heard of that before. tell me more about Iguanas please
The Austrian naturalist Laurenti found them in 1768
Do they live in America?
I think so. Mostly in South America and Central America
I love learning about other cultures and I will definitely look for more info about them
Iguanas are actually herbivorous!
That's interesting .
Iguana's are pretty neat, they're native to Mexico and South America. Do you have one?
i don't. they are cool. do they get big?
They can, their length can range from big to small, including their tail
i heard even many feet in length.  what do they eat?
An iguana is an herbivorous lizard. Only plants!
that's goood to know! do they carry Salmonella?
I don't think so, but the  exact number of those infected by iguanas is unknown
i wonder if it's hard to get their environment right to keep as a pet?
i always wanted an iguana!
They would make a cool pet.  What Kind of Iguana do you want?
I honestly don't know! are there different types of iguanas?
Looks like there might be a few, but I'm not sure.  Maybe Blue and Green are they most common type.  The Green one come from Brazil and Paraguay
i didn't know that! What else do you know about iguana?
The Blue Iguana comes form the Grand Cayman.  I might not want an iguana for a pet but I'll visit where they are from any day!
I bet these Blue Iguanas are so beautiful
I agree they would be something to see.  I read that they can live up to 68 years old.  I had no idea they lived so long.
what?? I can't believe it! They live longer than any other pets i've ever had
That would be right up there with Parrots I think.  At least you'd have a companion for social interaction for a very long time!
I love Iguanas!  They have always been my favorite reptile.  First described in 1768 by an Austrian NIcolaus Laurenti.
What sets Iguanas apart from other reptiles like Lizard?
Well for one they can range in length, including their tails.  The name was derived from the Taino name "Iwana".
That's really interesting, I always thought it was a unique name. 
There are actually two types of Iguana as well.  The Green Iguana and the the lesser Antilles Iguana.
So, what's the difference?
The lesser Iguana is a little bit smaller.  Both possess a dewlap though, which is a row of spines running down their backs to their tails.
Awesome. It sounds like a little dinosaur.
It could be!  Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles and we know that Iguanas are also reptiles!
I wonder if there are more types of Iguana though.
Iguana (, ) is a genus of herbivorous lizards that are native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, South America\
My next door neighbor had an Iguana as a pet.  I don't know why.  You can't cuddle with an iguana!  
Two species are included in the genus "Iguana": the green iguana, which is widespread throughout its range and a popular pet, and the Lesser Antillean iguana
Theirs must be a green iguana, then.  I'm scared of them.  Do they bite humans?
The green iguana is also known as the American iguana, is a large, arboreal, mostly herbivorous species of lizard of the genus
Is there an ecological advantage to iguanas?  What do they eat?
sure! thats because they  iguana feeds almost exclusively on algae and large males dive to find this food source, while females and smaller males feed during low tide in the intertidal zone.
Really?  Can iguanas swim?
I have been told my neighbor's iguana got loose.  Should I be worried?  They kept it in the bathtub.
Do you keep lizards as pet?is a genus of herbivorous lizards that are native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, South America
I don't, my neighbor does.  I have a small dog that I worry about.  Are iguanas dangerous?
Well ,they dont seem to be,he genus was first described in 1768 by Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in his book "Specimen Medicum, Exhibens Synopsin Reptilium 
Well I feel a little better, then.  What if I see the iguana?  How do I catch it?
Well it depends on the color you want to catch,either the green iguana or blue
Oh no.  I don't what color it is.  I think green?  Is that good or bad?
The blue iguana  also known as the Grand Cayman iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana or Cayman Island
I think if I see it I am just going to call animal control to get it.  
pls do! Moreso,In addition to the two species in the genus "Iguana", several other related genera in the same family have common names of the species 
I have a pet Iguana a herbivorous lizard, his name is Lurch
That's sweet. What does he eat?
He eats Hibiscus flowers and has bumpy scales on his neck like spokes
Does he change colors?
No but the Lesser Antilean does and they are endangered
I see. How long does an iguana typically live?
Not sure? And they vary in range of length depending on species
How many species of iguana are there?
My friend's daughter has a green iguana, a popular pet apparently.
I love iguanas. Such cool and docile pets I have heard.
I just can't imagine.  The can live to be 20 years old! 
WOW. I didn't know their life span was that long. Amazing creatures.
Iguanas have a dewlap, which is a spine and OMG a tiny 3rd eye on their heads! Creepy!
I never heard the term Delap. That is a cool name. I am definetly sure I never heard they had a 3rd eye.
I guess green iguana pets better than bule iguana.  They can live for up to 69 years! No way no way.
Holy. That is very long life span. More than triple that of the normal iguana.
Iguana ,please I really can't decipher the meaning
Iguanas are basically a type of herbivore lizards from tropical areas.
Lizard? Are they dangerous?
Nope, like I said iguanas are herbivores and therefore only eat plant life.
OK that's good
Yup, they were discovered quite a while ago too, as they were described as early as 1768 by Josephus Nicolaus.
What other type of lizard specie are there?
There are stuff like chameleons too. Though to stay on Iguanas, they can really range in size and length, especially when including their tail.
Tell me more about cameleon
Well they range in colors and in addition many species are able to change their color.
I always wanted to get a pet iguana. They are herbivorous lizards from Central America.
Wow, that's an exotic pet! How big do iguanas get?
They can range in length depending on species. The biggest ones can be almost six feet!
Whoa! I can't imagine! And they are herbivorous, so no meat? I wonder what their favorite thing to eat is. 
That is correct they are herbivorous lizards. They like all kinds of greens such as kale and lettuce.
Oh I seem to remember a kid I knew years ago had an iguana and they fed him lettuce. I wonder if they are very interactive with humans when they are kept as pets. 
The green iguana is a popular pet and does interact with their owners. Especially when they know they are getting fed.
Ha, funny how the food brings them around. Do iguanas come in different colors? I think I have only seen green ones. 
I hate Iguana I heard they are huge in Mexico. 
Iguanas do look scary. Are they dangerous?
No despite them being very large in length and long with that huge tail they are won't harm but they do look like they will I still beware lol.
Yea I would definitely go the other way. What else can you tell me about these creatures?
They come in a range of colors from brightness like yellow, green and they have pale scale on they head they can blend in a lot with surroundings so always be careful.
Wow. They are somewhat fascinating. What do they eat?
They eat mostly plants, leaves green things so they won't eat you they are widespread around where it is mostly green always.
Oh I thought it would be insects. They dont seem as scary as I first thought now that I know a little more about them.
Do you like the genus of herbivorous lizards from tropical mexico and central america known as the iguana?
iguana are quite cool but can be annoying little guys when you get a lot of them
Yeah i bet. The word iguana is actually derived from the Taino for species iwana.
huh I didnt know that but it makes sense once you hear it
Yeah it does. On another note do you like the New  york stock exhange? The one established in 1862?
No real opinion to be honest, not something ive dealt with much in life
Oh true. I just like it because ive been to the fifth trading room located at 30 broad street.
oh thats quite cool, id like to visit new york in genral some day
It may seem odd to say, but I have Iguana, a genus of herbivorous lizards as a pet. I keep it just to have some partner whom can just be by my side
Wow. I don't really know much about lizards, especially Iguanas.
Mine is green iguana which is also known as American Iguana. They are very calm and attentive creatures which makes you just stare at them
I guess I have never thought of them as calm, probably because they make me nervous.
they are not that scary, but calm and relaxed creatures. Just like the novel series The "Warriors" depicts calm people as scary
I believe you. I just didn't know much about them and sometimes we fear what we don't understand. Maybe you could tell me more.
To get more acquainted and get rid of nervousness, i would recommend you to watch Nandini, an Indian supernatural television drama. That would help to a certain degree
I've never heard of that television drama. What is it about?
They are also much like BBC television dramas that have been produced to get you over the nervousness with smooth scenery shots
You seem to know so much. Are there any really cool facts about them?
Have you ever owned a Iguana? I recently got a female and a male. They can vary in length based on the gender
No way I am so scared of iguanas do you play or hold them?  
O let them sit in a tree most of the time and they love it. I just learned that they have a third eye and it senses light
 Where is the third eye located?
It is on the top of the head
Wow at the top so they actually don't need that one most likely, what kind of things do they feed off of? 
The mostly eat bugs, But the third eye looks like a pale scale and it can only make out light nothing else.
So that is how they determine the time of the day from that eye, what kind of bugs like crickets or flies? 
Yeah in the wild im sure they hunt small rodents as well. The come from south America and the carribbean
I seen pictures of iguanas in the Caribbean and those things look big as dogs lol I would be to scared. 
I have 2 pet Iguanas!
Are they green iguanas or lesser Antilles Iguanas?
Mine are the Antilles Iguanas. Do you have Iguanas?
No, i would never have Iguanas as a pet. they are way too much trouble to care for.
Hmm, what makes you say that? 
About 70% of Iguanas in captivity die as a result of bad diet, poor lighting, and other housing conditions.  If i were to get one, it would be a blue iguana.
Yes, you do have to give them good care especially since they are in decline. I am hoping mine will mate! Blue Iguanas are beautiful.
Yes, they are.  Blues can live the longest of any iguana, up to 69 years....talk about a lifetime pet.
Iguanas are so cool.   I have a few as pets.
Iguana is genus of herbivorous
oh really does that mean they only eat plants?
The genus was first described in 1768
That was a long time ago.  I am trying to learn more about them as I am new iguana pet owner.  How long do they get?
It was described by Austrian naturalist 
Thats cool.  DO you know if they make good pets?
It is a popular pet
Do they really slap their tails when they  feel threatened?
Yes. Behind their necks are small scales which resembles spokes
I have a pet iguana from Mexico! Not as cuddly as a dog, but I love him anyway. His name is Ignacio, Iggy for short.
Are Iguanas good pets? They sound pretty easy to care for.
Well, you have to be careful. Diet, lighting, and other housing for a green iguana like mine causes too many to die in captivity too soon.
What is the average lifespan for an iguana?
They can live to be up to 20 years old! Of course, that's if they're properly cared for.
Oh wow that's such a long life! I didn't know that.
I know! Another fun fact: they have this light-sensing organ that looks like a pale scale on the top of their head called the parietal eye. It senses brightness (not details, like a real eye!)
That's interesting. Does it help them see in the dark?
I love Iguanas! I think they are so funny.
yeah. they are found mostly in the central and south american regions.
Well here in Florida they are quite common too,  
While that is true, they are not native to the region. They are either brought from their natural habitat and/or bred there
I used to catch Iguanas growing up, but don't worry I would later release them unharmed (at least physically)
Haha.. i think you know they vary greatly in length
Yes the really small ones seem pretty delicate and almost transparent.
true. by the way, the scales behind their necks are known as tuberculate scales
Interesting, and I think they can regrow their tail id they lose it, right?
there is a third eye on them, This light-sensing organ is known as the parietal eye
Have you ever seen an Iguana? They are herbivore lizards? 
Oh yes ive seen them before, Ive always wanted one as a pet, But never had the proper cages or know how to take care of them. 
That would be pretty cool. The iguana is native to tropical countries like South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.
Oh cool! I do see them all the time in the news, I hear they are an invasive species in certain places. Do you know how old iguanas live for? 
Usually about 12 years. The small scale behind the iguanas ears that look like spokes are called tuberculate scales.
Oh ok thats not so bad then, How big do iguanas get? Id liek to maybe get one that doesnt grow too big. 
Iguanas range in length including the tail. Some males can get over 5ft in length
Over 5 feet! thats insane! I'm not sure I ever seen one that long before. Do you happen to know if iguanas are good around kids, do they bite? 
Im not to sure. Ive just studied wild ones. The iguana also has a pale scale on their head that can sense light brightness.
Oh ok and thats pretty fascinating, What else do you know about iguanas? 
I love Iguanas, I have a few as pets. Do you like lizards at all?
Yes, I like them. They are interesting.and prehistoric looking.  I like turtles too.
I agree, they definitely have a prehistoric look to them. There are also over 6000 species spread across the world.
Do they have teeth and does their bite hurt if they bite you?
My Iguanas have teeth but they have never bitten me. I don't think it would hurt terribly because mine are small. Iguanas can vary in length though.
Do you let them run around the house and do they get along with other animals?
I don't let them run around the house, usually they stay in their container instead. Occasionally my friend brings her dog and they seem to get along when I bring them out briefly.
What do they eat? I've heard they need warmth and a lot of sunlight.
Iguanas are lizards native to central america and the caribbean.
How big do they get?
They can range in their length.
Oh what else can you tell me? What do they eat?
They're herbivores, so they eat a lot of plants.
Good to know cause I was a little scared of them lol
They have a third eye, so it would be bad if they weren't.
Now that is just plain creepy lol
It is, but you wouldn't have to worry about them unless you lived in mexico or south america.
I have a few Iguanas. They're pretty exciting pets. Have you ever seen one? 
Yes, I have one of the more common ones, the green iguana. 
Awesome. They are very good swimmers. I take them in our pool outside sometimes. They look a lot like dinosaurs!
How big are yours? Mine are fairly small. 
They are close to 1 meter. Do you know where iguanas originate?
They were first described in 1768 by an Austrian naturalist. 
Interesting, and from what area of the world are they from?
They can be found in Mexico, Central America, South American, and the Caribbean
Cool. I just bought mine at the pet store! It's amazing to think they come from these areas. 
Does yours have scales behind their neck?
I used to have a pet Iguana. His name was Junior.
Aww..I bet it was cute! I read that lizards are native to tropical areas of Mexico, central america, south america, and the carribean
I live in a sub-tropical area. I used to take him out on the beach and he liked to swim in the surf.
There are two species of "Iguana" the green iguana and the lesser antillaean Iguana
Junior was a green iguana. His favorite food was Strawberries.
I read they can range in length including their tail.  About how long was yours?
He wasn't super long. Maybe a couple of feet. Kinda a little guy as iguanas go.
I read that they have a third eye on their heads
Do they really? I never noticed that. One fun factoid though: I fed him a vegetarian diet. If you feed them meat, you risk salmonella when handling them.
I also read they have a row of spines running down their backs
