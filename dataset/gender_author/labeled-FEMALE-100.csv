this place has gone down hill .
no one showed up or even called .
however , the steakhouse still called the cops .
wife likes spice and they can do that too .
not that great tasted stale .
an unsatisfactory dish improperly reheated : fail .
this place is right next to my house .
on to the positives and new things .
just one of my personal pet peeves .
great addition to noda .
lots of food to chose from .
this place blows more than jenna <UNK> .
in fact table had empty plates for awhile .
no crab legs or anything with a hard shell .
great little spot tucked away in the foothills .
not one thing in the dish stood out .
a night worthy of a celebration if you will .
not quite fine dining but not diner food either .
they are always fairly prompt and adequately friendly .
my favorite grocers store !
the chicken was good not great .
been there multiple times in the last few weeks .
great for puppy training and starting fires .
the sweet shrimp was pretty nice as well .
then had the bone in filet .
the corn in a cup is delicious .
the food was served hot and was very attractive .
the italian beef is my favorite in town .
the bathroom was old , the shower sucks .
dishwasher has not been properly installed and leaks .
cold toppings is badass to say the least .
my wife and her friend split the chicken dish .
the fried rice was pretty darned good too .
the wife had a hard time eating it .
definitely the best burger on mill .
my wife and i have been here allot .
cooked tender - crisp .
overall great bar , service , and food .
the food is pretty authentic .
zoe ' s is ` ` ok ' ' .
had n't been back here in sometime .
that shows your food quality standards have fallen .
i will come back for next haircut .
most importantly good food .
table went out of business for a reason .
i got lazy and stuck to the prime rib .
the decorations were minimalist , simple and not overdone .
food highest quality , service exceptional .
she shrugged and walked away .
your horchata is delicious as is the watermelon lemonade .
decent food for the price .
it is upscale american .
the pork belly was very very tender as well .
worst of all with this meal were my drinks .
excellent food , friendly service .
great food and service !
food was pretty good .
reasonably priced with great toppings .
this place consistently makes awesome food .
cheese plate could <UNK> been bigger but very tasty .
managed to have some dessert as well .
my favorite dish was the lamb curry .
the desert and drink menu is top notch .
not your typical sweet and sour but spicy .
beer is a little pricy but great selection .
good food and very affordable .
love the pizza here and everything else .
do n't order the sourdough cheeseburger special .
well worth checking out .
also the rack of lamb is good to .
the service is friendly & the food is outstanding .
00 fitness @user ann rd is very good gym .
but ultimately folks come here for the orange juice .
interesting bagels and some interesting ethnic dishes .
the breakfasts there were sublime .
a very good family style italian restaurant .
they had far better appetizers and nigiri .
good real german food .
as a banquet venue , they were below expectations .
the food at wine five is outstanding !
both were out of this world .
this place is a joke .
they come out fresh every couple of minutes .
grab a book , learn something !
was somewhat suprised that the restaurant was not full .
i have partied around the fucking globe .
the pulled pork had good moist flavor and texture .
the soy sauce chicken had very little chicken meat .
the flavor was excellent .
the meat was very good .
meh , borderline but i enjoy it enough .
real plates instead of paper is nice touch too .
even better , its all you can eat .
however the food still came out late .
the menu is quite diverse .
same food with better prices can be found elsewhere .
hopefully , the same holds for your other delights .
i have been coming here for years .
food did come in a timely fashion .
good post bar food .
