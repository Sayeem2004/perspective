the food quality was great .
the hostess and wait staff are very attentive too .

service and food have never been better .
this place is a joke .
bathtub needs some paint work .
onion rings are lightly battered and tasty .
good selection of craft beers .
nice array of selections other than burgers too .
we held our bachelor party here .
another high point for me was the unfiltered sake .
and probably quite a few more visits after that .
well there was no mayo .
then the kids baby back ribs .
it was not a breaded chicken breast .
there were some couples there as well .
the restaurant is charging premium prices for burgers .
burgers are good if you get them medium .
all sodas are n't worth the price .
my hat is off to these wonderful folks .
tons of options and cheap margaritas on tuesday !
jacuzzi tub with a tv .
my room was ok , though .

this is the best indian food in las vegas .
if your used to eating trash indian food .
this is real indian food .
now as for the cheesesteaks ... .
this location closed mid december 0000 .
only complaint is the water from the drinking fountains .
most have the same prices on their web site .
so hastily departed the facility .
this store is a little different from most .
this charlotte store did not have a breakfast menu .
the egg noodles were firm and plump .
- choose the girl rather than being chosen .
impressive selection with above average food .
this place is a joke .
i ' m a fan .

this one , i spit it out .
the poutine is n't very good .
is it good for a date ?
the meat patty was pretty big too .
how was the poutine ?
the were well cooked , and of big size .
classic quebec diner in the middle of the plateau .
their hotdogs are pretty much just regular diner quality .
this review has more to do with the poutine .
the sauce of the regular poutine was average .
the mexican poutine was interesting .
this was our favorite vegas restaurant experience .
please christmas break , come faster .
so much for the saloon atmosphere .
it was just a very very blend dish .
not a good vietnamese by any standard .
the decor is very simple , and unassuming .
save your money and buy food somewhere else .
. food pretty good .
i ordered the shrimp cocktail and buffalo chicken flatbread .
great customer ... food came out really fast .
came here while in town for the ncaa tournament .

the crust makes the pizza .
the chalet is the best .

both the food and service were great each evening .
i told her make it 0:00 or forget it .

my wife and i love taking our daughter here .
freezer burnt , mediocre at best ice cream .

the waitresses are polite and come by often .
the food was excellent and not too pricey .
the carnitas are out of this world !
the pancakes are fluffy and tasty .
we also ordered chicken tenders with fries .
get someone with a nicer personality .
thin new york style crust is just right .
the food items are high quality worth the price .
we ' ll see how good this food is .
adventurous menu badly executed .
the drink selection is attractive .
i chose the pork belly ramen .
flavorless broth and overcooked belly .
very fair pricing in particular for vegas .
strongly advise advance reservations .
the meat was the worst .
but even without it , the burger was awesome .
burgers are very unique .
all donuts are cooked to order .
the worst part was that the burger was flavorless .

what what in your cold stone .
the seafood selection is diverse and priced right .
menu is extensive as well .
the food was more on the bland side .
proportion wise was fine .
but the quality of the food needs to improve .
anyhow , a great place but mediocre food .
i really did not expect anything special .
good food and drinks makes a difference .

the sauce used made it extraordinary delicious .
the food presentation was magnificent .
now you know what i eat the most .
the buffet is well kept and very clean .
but come and enjoy anyways .

my complaint here is the food .

overall bland flavors likely made to please the masses .

started with some great warm cornbread .
i also got the corn ... tremendous .
the sauce was rich and buttery , very good .
the chicken was a little disappointing ... tough .

some feedback to the buffet staff .
the food quality was just ok .
best japanese food in las vegas .
had the yellow tail sashimi and it was unbelievable .
my wife and i love this place .
the crust fell apart and the pie became mush .
the crumb topping was also terrible .
there was n't anything wrong with the food .
the pork lo mien was a disappointment as well .
the crust has no crispness to it .
good range from traditional to modern designs .
0 star more because chef is good .
i just wish the food here was as good .
we got some really cheaply priced drinks .
and i think a wasabi cocktail sauce ?
well folks the time is now .
great service and food lived up to the billing .
and the cod was the tastiest fish ever .
i shop here all the time .
the lemonade like 0000 ' s powdered juice .
you will not be disappointed .
avoid this store at all costs .
the food is fine , but nothing special .
the furnishings were contemporary and plush .
does anyone actually shop here ?
the ribeye was a low grade supermarket cut .
avoid this place unless you are almost starving .
traditional margaritas are very good .
had a great meal there .
bathroom is big and unremarkable .
the scallops were done very well .
minuses : menu selection , hit and miss dishes .
second time we ate here at chandler mall .
tough lobster nice talkative waiter .
ordered a beef bbq noodle with an entree .
not the most amazing side dishes .
they serve mainly locally sourced ingredients .
i like my sausages and eggs .
it has been a popular restaurant for many years .
great food , new management , greatly improved .
they make a great spicy tuna roll .
spectacular service and great food .
let ' s cover the food shall we ?
perhaps i like the pita more .
the garlic potatoes were good .
the fruit selection is impressive .
want a variety of cold cuts or cheese ?
they were fresh , moist sesame bagels .
because everyone is honest right ?
` ` that ' s a shame .
succulent and moist beyond comparison !
there are better options in town .
the standard plate should feed most people .
the big plate is quite a treat .
but ultimately folks come here for the orange juice .
so many mustache <UNK> can be had .
the price tag was decent as well .
the meat was very good .
served with choice of breads and fresh fruit garnish .
the food came in 00 minutes .
the potatoes were decent .
many dishes needed a lot of salt .
the chicken was provided 00 minutes later .
too liquidy , flavor was n't there .
i felt like a big burger .
the price tag is decent as well .
their lava cakes are also out of this world .
the curds were real but the gravy was off .
eating the fries however were pretty much excellent .
all in all , decent but much better available .
it ' s an experience in itself .
i particularly enjoyed the lamb .
the sauce was in particular was average .
i recommend this meal to anyone .
walked in at 0:00 , sat down at 0:00 .
the mongolian beef <UNK> supreme .
refills are never a problem .
- ca n't decide on a cuisine ?
- the mongolian lamb was n't impressive at all .
the condiments were fresh and quite generous .
this is what a standard poutine should taste like .
they were good and we ' ll prepared .
our waitress was very accommodating and on point .
i ' ve had far better .
the fattoush salad is exceptional as well .
make sure to shop for your items wisely .
best buy is a hard sell for me .
the hot chocolate was delicious without being too sweet .
the bread tasted old and the meat flavorless .
sauce was zesty and the dough actually seemed fresh .
once again , unsalted .
this place has the best fries , bar none .
the fries were excellent however .
the fries though are perfect deli fries .
i actually prefer it like this .
my only issue about the place ?
just perfect for the right occasions .
greek potatoes are awesome .
specialty is the chicken and the lamb .
i recommend sharing it with folks .
why do you accept reservations ?
portions were small , were n't all that great .
asked for medium rare , got it medium rare .
for dessert my wife ordered the fried oreos .
the chicken tenders are great as well .
refills are free however .
let ' s be honest .
am i making you hungry ?
- take out counter next door is fantastic .
was this made in house ?
that porchetta made me thirsty !
we were perfectly fine upstairs .
the sausages did n't float my boat neither .
the japanese gardens are excellent as well .
will this be an experience like none other ?
none of the meats stood out being excellent .
the mushrooms and grilled pineapple were very good however .
how can you suck so much at serving meat ?
what ' s not to like ?
this salad was very disappointing to say the least .
economical style bread in both quality and size .
refills are never a problem .
they were very tasty , albeit quite sweet .
the goods are sublime .
will not only solve their long waits ... .
silly staff woman ca n't handle 0 sandwiches .
you either love them or hate them .
the bacon were crisp and tasty .
the eggs were done just right .
burgers are exceptionally well done .
- prices are honest and fair .
service requires a big improvement in this restaurant .
been there a few times for lunch .
that thing is tasty and <UNK> .
fresh tasty beef available for hamburger lovers .
the appetizers arrived relatively quickly - lrb - thankfully !
it was quite tasty however .
the mushroom soup was excellent .
the salad and rice was solid additions as well .
coffee was included as well .
the fries were also solid .
chicken n ' waffles baby !
let ' s talk about these bubbles .
juicy , succulent , flavourful .
they cut the meat right from the rotisserie .
best 0am food uptown .
great for the small plate dinners and entrees alike .
now the food was literally out of this world .
have been back for various caesar experiences like cher !
great store amazing place to eat .
fantastic store a must go to store .
we took pictures and got a tee shirt .
the meats are always cooked on point .
the flavors are there , no sauce needed .
took my wife and daughter here .
i ordered the steak chili baker .
the chili inside - stone cold .
it can only meet low expectations , right ?
excellent prices and portions for lunch & dinner .
plates were <UNK> , silverware polished , and clean .
i will have them back in the future .
have been coming here for years .
even got my wife to try it !
good prices for very good food !
the food is outstanding .
could be served colder , but whatever .
royal palms - such memories !
i did the tasting menu with wine pairings .
nice work mac , wherever you are .
all the <UNK> dogs are awesome .
the onion rings are the best in town .
annual staycation for wife ' s birthday .
they make one hell of a zombie too !
pure and utter dog poop .
excellent meal ... excellent service .
i will be eating here every week .
blood orange margarita is off the chart .
will be eating here often .
really nice clean fresh ingredients prepared with care .
overall , very positive experience .
the decline of this restaurant is very disconcerting .
good food and zesty margaritas ... lovin ' this .
they have a bit of a smokey flavor .
my favorite is the white ipa .
the chimichanga was fried perfectly .
fries were room temperature and very stale .
great service and great food .
will now be my vegas favorite .
small portion and flavor was ok .
mediocre italian style food .
would i go again to the vegas restaurant ?
thanks buck & honey ' s
their wings are huge & meaty .
was a feast of beefy goodness .
and rather bland as well .
good prices and drinks .
how do you people live with yourselves ?
my wife had the salmon eggs benedict .
the absolute best egg foo yung in town !
size of shop was small but still comfortable .
i thought these were some of the most popular ?
this review is going to be short and sweet .
this place uses all quality organic ingredients .
got the grass-fed burger and hibiscus iced tea .
the burger was juicy and overall a tasty lunch .
the fried rice and dumplings were excellent .
put in a pond in our back yard .
fantastic landscaping and great ponds .
she had the nerve to serve burnt coconut shrimp .
worst place for a first date .
your food is looking back at you .
but still out of my price range .
friendly staff and delicious food at a reasonable price .
this place is the worst !
my biggest disappointment was with their kitchen setup .
very good quality food and service .
good solid chinese food that actually delivers .
i can live with the flaws .
thanks you pens for a lifetime if awesomeness .
my wife and i both had salads .
not a bad selection of beers , either .
i was alone and interested in a combination plate .
food is great and the service is equally good .
beer is a little pricy but great selection .
always a mess and lacking proportioned ingredients .
gourmet pizza it is not .
chow fun and fried flounder were excellent !
a little slice of comfort .
pretty satisfying end to the meal .
it was simple , cooked well , and tasty .
our expectations were exceeded from beginning to end .
is that solid bacon grease inside your bacon doughnut ?
at least they like their customers .
food was very good .
however the food still came out late .
and that lobster bisque ... heavenly .
the bacon-wrapped scallops were amazing .
food is tremendous , service impeccable .
i will definitely be a returning customer here !
the food , you are wondering ?
food went down hill .
the food is good .
food is generally good .
i have eaten there twice .
it wo n't be a miss , i promise .
the rooms look nothing like the pictures .
minced pork noodles are fantastic !
the waitress was a complete jerk as well .
ribs fell off the bone and chicken was fantastic .
ribs are my choice whenever i go out .
prices were okay , especially during happy hour .
i judge on the experience of the restaurant .
not the best i ' ve ever had .
the food is excellent .
the shrimp is huge and tastes incredible .
they never hold back on the meat .
to top it off ?
very nice waitresses and waiters .
they use nice portions for all the seafood .
the salmon skin roll is excellent , just saying .
the garlic knots are also decent .
today our bellies could not withstand ayce as usual .
ambiance is laid back and cool .
nice cheese , shame about the service .
every item on the menu is great .
the food there is always really good .
the sauce and the crust are just <UNK> .
the bottles are also very expensive .
. its so bad that its funny at times .
the chicken however , was terrible .
. then finally they bring out the food .
that was another stupid decision .
do n't look at the price tag just enjoy .
went in the other day to fix a flat .
or maybe just on denial .
if you are from texas do n't eat here .
the thin crusts rays nice and firm .
went for dinner this evening .
wife and i went on a saturday night .
nice decor , interesting atmosphere , diverse crowd .
really good food , great owner .
