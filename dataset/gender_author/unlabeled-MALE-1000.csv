where locals go for sushi .
it also helps that this is literally amazing coffee .
the seating area could be cleaner .
i can not get over this place .

this place just gets it .
great local place for moon valley .
congrats to joe and <UNK> for another great concept .
this week the special was fried lobster and chips .
fuego is a good time tex-mex street food place .
<UNK> are absolutely spot on .
my favourite dish was shrimp tempura roll .
otherwise they would surely have got only one star .
pizzas tasted way below average .
borders were n't crunchy , but really doughy .
what an enjoyable experience .
their avacado blows my mind .
no one faces the bar which is odd .
these sorts of places are relative .
experience was better than expected .
would highly suggest doing this with a small group .
how can a sandwich joint not have mayo .
this place is a front for the russian mob .
that was not the case here .
wife and kids enjoyed the <UNK> .
the tiramisu was also very good .
the menu looked impressive with very reasonable prices .
the waiter was very friendly .
the waiter moved us to another table .
two of the kids split the ribs .
had salami and mushroom pizza .
had a medium cheese pizza .
service - sub par .
the service should match .
skip desert as well .
not a mochi fan , but my wife is .
i liked this place better than yama sushi .
well reviewed for good reason .
they all had the same strategy .
does the ac / heater work ?
does the sliding door to the balcony work ?
- rrb - old-school tube tv .
<UNK> waiting after 00 minutes .
the sides however were entirely delightful .
not sure if i ' ll be back .

the variety of music was a pleasant surprise .
you cant go wrong with <UNK> .
the decor is <UNK> .
the old fashioned kind you attach to a hose .
a real imax theatre , not just named one .
brake masters is not a rip off .
i feel very confident in their skill and honesty .
strange thing goin on with pricing .
thats kind of deceiving to potential new customers .
the old stuff is n't noticed as easily .
local management changes all the time .
tempe is still the neglected one .
that was about about 0:00 .
there ' s plenty of staff on hand .
an outdoor table is a must .
. this is a smokers paradise .
a few hours later a supervisor called .
got hosed on my award item .
i will never ever contract with cox again .
this club has self checkout .
scan your card and grab a hand held .
it has some issues on a daily basis .
if you ' re middle aged , good luck .
signage : poor to non existent .
years and years of poor planning .
in serious need of a make over .
a better produce section than main & alma school .
the food is great .
why the number sign then ?
just bizarre i love this place .
some sections are a bit cramped though .
similar concept time warp banking .
like banking in the early ' 00s .
excellent meat and produce department .
it cramped and this is not it .

avoid this tourist trap at all costs .
the food is amazing and the prices unbelievable .
and their charges were more than reasonable .
drink prices and entry <UNK> reasonable .
nothing had changed at all .
this is one odd little neighborhood diner .
the restaurant also doubles as a bar .
not a bad place , not stellar either .
$ 00 after tip .
yes , the poutine was a letdown .
the bahn mi dog however , was outstanding .
not the easiest place to get to .
they take us dollars at par .
classic greasy spoon in the <UNK> .
there ' s a reason for this .
<UNK> frozen fries and <UNK> cheese curds .
the gravy is a power , but sufficiently spicy .
or have good bbq .
at 0pm on a tuesday .
overall , it was a decent burger .
not a $ 00 cheeseburger .
what do you know about poutine ?
the poutine was just as described .
the poutine is a dissapointment .
the rooms were fine but minimal .
interesting <UNK> in <UNK> .
the place has the typical montreal chinatown look .
the bill was moderate .
a good broth takes a long time .
we had two full <UNK> boxes .
one star knocked off for the service .
not bad , not good , but not memorable .
the place itself is very simple .
- rrb - , <UNK> screamed attitude .
the ribs were fall off the bone .
you never go to verdun .
both fulfill the basic requirements .
$ 0 with taxes for the one pictured above .

this places does it right in the details .
it is very good .
cheese : cheddar cheese curds .
big props for the orange glazed donut also .
it ' s really two separate places .
the shrimp and vegetables meal was average .
if you feel like experimenting , why not .
the good + 0 for the giant poutine .
montreal pool room is an institution .
any place would be better than here .
00hr spot in the sls hotel .

went well with a good guinness .
cool little spot to pop in when in charlotte .
the beer was a tad <UNK> .
the seasoning was unbelievable .
tons of beers of tap as well .
<UNK> come back when in charlotte .
cool bar , and nice <UNK> .
really nice whole foods location .
price is moderate to high .
overall it was a good meal .
cool hotel right in the heart of the epicenter .
so factor that into your stay .
seriously this place is trying to scam people .

every other one was a toby keith video .
join the rest of the 00st century vegas .
where the hell is your swimming pool ?
things i liked about harrah ' s : 0 .
$ 0.00 heineken keg cans in the lobby store .
$ 0 miller lite .

this place appears that it could be pretty cool .
that shit was choking me all night .
crispy and friggin good .
never had any issues with maintenance or noise .
good omelet ' s and great <UNK> .
what more could you ask for ?
im a huge fan of <UNK> .
<UNK> is the real deal .
no , not <UNK> : montreal .
do n't waist your time .
overpriced , low end italian food .
poor , i attentive wait staff .
succeeds as a tourist trap !
i would give them a zero if i could .
plus the owner is a dick .
the sides are solid too .
just a great all around experience .
in a mostly empty dining room .
not the case here .
all in all distinctly average with slow service .
