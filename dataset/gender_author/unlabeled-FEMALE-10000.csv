the food quality was great .
the hostess and wait staff are very attentive too .

service and food have never been better .
this place is a joke .
bathtub needs some paint work .
onion rings are lightly battered and tasty .
good selection of craft beers .
nice array of selections other than burgers too .
we held our bachelor party here .
another high point for me was the unfiltered sake .
and probably quite a few more visits after that .
well there was no mayo .
then the kids baby back ribs .
it was not a breaded chicken breast .
there were some couples there as well .
the restaurant is charging premium prices for burgers .
burgers are good if you get them medium .
all sodas are n't worth the price .
my hat is off to these wonderful folks .
tons of options and cheap margaritas on tuesday !
jacuzzi tub with a tv .
my room was ok , though .

this is the best indian food in las vegas .
if your used to eating trash indian food .
this is real indian food .
now as for the cheesesteaks ... .
this location closed mid december 0000 .
only complaint is the water from the drinking fountains .
most have the same prices on their web site .
so hastily departed the facility .
this store is a little different from most .
this charlotte store did not have a breakfast menu .
the egg noodles were firm and plump .
- choose the girl rather than being chosen .
impressive selection with above average food .
this place is a joke .
i ' m a fan .

this one , i spit it out .
the poutine is n't very good .
is it good for a date ?
the meat patty was pretty big too .
how was the poutine ?
the were well cooked , and of big size .
classic quebec diner in the middle of the plateau .
their hotdogs are pretty much just regular diner quality .
this review has more to do with the poutine .
the sauce of the regular poutine was average .
the mexican poutine was interesting .
this was our favorite vegas restaurant experience .
please christmas break , come faster .
so much for the saloon atmosphere .
it was just a very very blend dish .
not a good vietnamese by any standard .
the decor is very simple , and unassuming .
save your money and buy food somewhere else .
. food pretty good .
i ordered the shrimp cocktail and buffalo chicken flatbread .
great customer ... food came out really fast .
came here while in town for the ncaa tournament .

the crust makes the pizza .
the chalet is the best .

both the food and service were great each evening .
i told her make it 0:00 or forget it .

my wife and i love taking our daughter here .
freezer burnt , mediocre at best ice cream .

the waitresses are polite and come by often .
the food was excellent and not too pricey .
the carnitas are out of this world !
the pancakes are fluffy and tasty .
we also ordered chicken tenders with fries .
get someone with a nicer personality .
thin new york style crust is just right .
the food items are high quality worth the price .
we ' ll see how good this food is .
adventurous menu badly executed .
the drink selection is attractive .
i chose the pork belly ramen .
flavorless broth and overcooked belly .
very fair pricing in particular for vegas .
strongly advise advance reservations .
the meat was the worst .
but even without it , the burger was awesome .
burgers are very unique .
all donuts are cooked to order .
the worst part was that the burger was flavorless .

what what in your cold stone .
the seafood selection is diverse and priced right .
menu is extensive as well .
the food was more on the bland side .
proportion wise was fine .
but the quality of the food needs to improve .
anyhow , a great place but mediocre food .
i really did not expect anything special .
good food and drinks makes a difference .

the sauce used made it extraordinary delicious .
the food presentation was magnificent .
now you know what i eat the most .
the buffet is well kept and very clean .
but come and enjoy anyways .

my complaint here is the food .

overall bland flavors likely made to please the masses .

started with some great warm cornbread .
i also got the corn ... tremendous .
the sauce was rich and buttery , very good .
the chicken was a little disappointing ... tough .

some feedback to the buffet staff .
the food quality was just ok .
best japanese food in las vegas .
had the yellow tail sashimi and it was unbelievable .
my wife and i love this place .
the crust fell apart and the pie became mush .
the crumb topping was also terrible .
there was n't anything wrong with the food .
the pork lo mien was a disappointment as well .
the crust has no crispness to it .
good range from traditional to modern designs .
0 star more because chef is good .
i just wish the food here was as good .
we got some really cheaply priced drinks .
and i think a wasabi cocktail sauce ?
well folks the time is now .
great service and food lived up to the billing .
and the cod was the tastiest fish ever .
i shop here all the time .
the lemonade like 0000 ' s powdered juice .
you will not be disappointed .
avoid this store at all costs .
the food is fine , but nothing special .
the furnishings were contemporary and plush .
does anyone actually shop here ?
the ribeye was a low grade supermarket cut .
avoid this place unless you are almost starving .
traditional margaritas are very good .
had a great meal there .
bathroom is big and unremarkable .
the scallops were done very well .
minuses : menu selection , hit and miss dishes .
second time we ate here at chandler mall .
tough lobster nice talkative waiter .
ordered a beef bbq noodle with an entree .
not the most amazing side dishes .
they serve mainly locally sourced ingredients .
i like my sausages and eggs .
it has been a popular restaurant for many years .
great food , new management , greatly improved .
they make a great spicy tuna roll .
spectacular service and great food .
let ' s cover the food shall we ?
perhaps i like the pita more .
the garlic potatoes were good .
the fruit selection is impressive .
want a variety of cold cuts or cheese ?
they were fresh , moist sesame bagels .
because everyone is honest right ?
` ` that ' s a shame .
succulent and moist beyond comparison !
there are better options in town .
the standard plate should feed most people .
the big plate is quite a treat .
but ultimately folks come here for the orange juice .
so many mustache <UNK> can be had .
the price tag was decent as well .
the meat was very good .
served with choice of breads and fresh fruit garnish .
the food came in 00 minutes .
the potatoes were decent .
many dishes needed a lot of salt .
the chicken was provided 00 minutes later .
too liquidy , flavor was n't there .
i felt like a big burger .
the price tag is decent as well .
their lava cakes are also out of this world .
the curds were real but the gravy was off .
eating the fries however were pretty much excellent .
all in all , decent but much better available .
it ' s an experience in itself .
i particularly enjoyed the lamb .
the sauce was in particular was average .
i recommend this meal to anyone .
walked in at 0:00 , sat down at 0:00 .
the mongolian beef <UNK> supreme .
refills are never a problem .
- ca n't decide on a cuisine ?
- the mongolian lamb was n't impressive at all .
the condiments were fresh and quite generous .
this is what a standard poutine should taste like .
they were good and we ' ll prepared .
our waitress was very accommodating and on point .
i ' ve had far better .
the fattoush salad is exceptional as well .
make sure to shop for your items wisely .
best buy is a hard sell for me .
the hot chocolate was delicious without being too sweet .
the bread tasted old and the meat flavorless .
sauce was zesty and the dough actually seemed fresh .
once again , unsalted .
this place has the best fries , bar none .
the fries were excellent however .
the fries though are perfect deli fries .
i actually prefer it like this .
my only issue about the place ?
just perfect for the right occasions .
greek potatoes are awesome .
specialty is the chicken and the lamb .
i recommend sharing it with folks .
why do you accept reservations ?
portions were small , were n't all that great .
asked for medium rare , got it medium rare .
for dessert my wife ordered the fried oreos .
the chicken tenders are great as well .
refills are free however .
let ' s be honest .
am i making you hungry ?
- take out counter next door is fantastic .
was this made in house ?
that porchetta made me thirsty !
we were perfectly fine upstairs .
the sausages did n't float my boat neither .
the japanese gardens are excellent as well .
will this be an experience like none other ?
none of the meats stood out being excellent .
the mushrooms and grilled pineapple were very good however .
how can you suck so much at serving meat ?
what ' s not to like ?
this salad was very disappointing to say the least .
economical style bread in both quality and size .
refills are never a problem .
they were very tasty , albeit quite sweet .
the goods are sublime .
will not only solve their long waits ... .
silly staff woman ca n't handle 0 sandwiches .
you either love them or hate them .

the fried rice and dumplings were excellent .
put in a pond in our back yard .
fantastic landscaping and great ponds .
she had the nerve to serve burnt coconut shrimp .

very good quality food and service .
good solid chinese food that actually delivers .
i can live with the flaws .
thanks you pens for a lifetime if awesomeness .
my wife and i both had salads .
not a bad selection of beers , either .

always a mess and lacking proportioned ingredients .
gourmet pizza it is not .
chow fun and fried flounder were excellent !
a little slice of comfort .
pretty satisfying end to the meal .

they never hold back on the meat .

the food there is always really good .
the sauce and the crust are just <UNK> .

tends towards trendy than timeless .
hash browns are homemade and top notch .
the food here is great .
and what flavor there is .
fourth time eating here .
the food was unique and tasty .
the pizzas are well prepared and shareable .
by far the chicken fried rice is the best .
ordered the cheese curds and the mesquite chicken sandwich .
beats other buffets in the east valley .
all ingredients are on the labels .
the toppings are always fresh .
the wife gave it a zero .
started with a freshly made guacamole .
i am sucker for a good green chile .
simply delicious ! ! give it a try .
same charbroiled burgers from my childhood .
price is a bit higher than robertos i think .
. got the chicken tenders with bbq .

phone number is incorrect .
really liked the product .
only knock : pedestrian french fries .
best pizza and wings in the valley .
very cool experience , and very tasty food .

lauren o ! ! ! a table of 00 .
i also had the chicken fried steak special .
she is n't doing you any favors .
they moved the clover here too .
welcomed like i was part of the family .
biggest mistake was not going to hickory tavern .
probably to compliment the stains on the pillow cases .
the fries were bland and tasteless at best .
charlie ' s is truly a despicable establishment .
they are sexist and will steal your money .
great prices , great products and great staff .
the not-so-great : fries are n't great here .
i feel they are stale and overcooked .
my girlfriend and i ordered from the brunch menu .
hands down best buffet in vegas .

my gf ordered the chicken and waffles .
the waffles were also very good .
food servings here are heaping .

the other dish was hot cakes .
the peppers are not hot .
it was just garlic powder and dry parmesean .
caprese salad was great small portion easily feeds two .
nice light crust good tomato sauce .
homestyle mexican food nothing fancy but tasty .
fish roll dipping sauce / paste was so good .
waitress said no ! ! ! .
maybe add some kind of rub or spice .
overpriced food and not that tasty .
generous portions fair prices and full bar .
happy hour prices are great on appetizers .

no ketchup at the table and no plates .
friendly fast fun to talk to .

this is our go to restaurant in madison .
server was very friendly .
the carrot soup others had was not bad .

the most memorable thing there was the desserts .
anything there with pork is money .
maybe a bit more or less formal ?
i would skip any other indian place in town .
vegan bread and butter was great .
chef needs to taste before serving .
cold and uncooked in the center .
get the tasting menu .
the texture and cooking temperature just blew my palate .
the attached wine store is great .
we began by sharing a bunch of apps .
my order came out perfect and quick .
too bad because the flavor was great .
the wine list is priced very high .
i miss california and corkage .
my biggest complaint is the complete lack of condiments .
no one was even half way through their soup .

it ' s friggin retail 000 .
anyway , onto the place itself .
no joke ... serve that stuff on a woman .
great service and good food and highly recommend .
the food is always good .
will be returning soon .
they were not very good .
rooms are poorly designed .
faux wood floor makes everything echo .
in fact faux wood furniture all around .
not ` bad ' , just nothing special .
also the food options sounded great as well .
too much food for one human .
this meal exceeded my expectations in every way .
it combined the best of savory and sweet .
pretty nice lobby and rooms .
hopefully the stay provides a better experience .
my wife had a similar problem with the bun .
good service , good beer , food is large !
kinda ridiculous this place is my favorite chinese food .
the hot and sour soup is incredible as well .
that ' s kinda lame .
the food is normally good .
they claim to be authentic jamaican food .
only disappointment was the fries .
all in all bad food and bad service .
but ... place was in serious need of cleaning .
they do not know how to cook seafood .
cattle in the herd .
they do not care about you as the customer .
got the lunch special almond chicken .
egg drop was usual .
i picked the southwestern chicken wrap .
the prices were very reasonable for the portions .
but the menu needs work in my opinion .
it was actually priced pretty reasonably .
the restaurant is in a converted old house .
the food is pretty authentic .
my wife got the pineapple fried rice .
went in for lunch .
staff is very friendly .
everything i ' ve had was very good .

below average sausage 0 .
i prefer mushrooms with steaks .
very good salad bar .
bread not very good .
not so great for wines , none was ordered .

pretty good mexican with some strengths and flaws .
very good sauces all around .
quality of cooking pretty high level .
better menu variety than typical mexican restaurant .

the suburban comes out clean every time .
asked for well done and still got medium rare .
the fries were fresh but not really prepared well .
are the fries too thin ?

do the burgers make all of that irrelevant ?
pop in a cd and eat some ice cream .
dealers at the tables are consistently smoking hot .
vanity - damn good on sunday nights .
. a <UNK> , <UNK> , overbearing woman .
there was not one redeeming quality to the meal .

now for the important part , the taste .
i am a platinum elite <UNK> member .
the food was really good for the price .
i think the restaurant in mesa is better .
the food was good and serving sizes were enormous .
the quality needs to be more consist .
well informed and specs before purchasing an item .

virtually all the pricing was identical .

the fries were the only saving grace .
thin and crispy the way they should be .
the food was good enough .
the om burger is good , too .
for dessert , the flourless cake was really good .
simple enough , right ?
i thought this place only specialized in asian dishes .
their collection and historical information blows the mind .
i would recommend this place for anyone else .
had a cleaning and a crown installed .
quality ingredients and great tasting food .
wife had pastor and chicken tacos .
- creamed corn - best side dish .
some of the best pork ever .
i ' ve never seen either of them smile .

we ' re hungry and pissed off .
bottom line : this is an epic restaurant .
this place is family focused .
choose one of them .
cold hot bar tasteless oranges tasteless apples .

perfect blend and amount .
the food is just acceptable .

taste and variety leave much to be desired .
now the food tastes like something anyone can make .
food is tasty and of a higher quality .
the bread is quite fresh and tasty .
best buffet in vegas .
pretty average pho restaurant .
your servers speak mandarin .
decent food but not necessarily presented authentically or professionally .
come here for dinner , avoid breakfast and lunch .
the wait is typically long .
service is as good as other vegas buffets offer .
the side dishes are tasty .
the basil chicken was pretty bad .
lol pretty simple menu .
pizza had the perfect crust .
good quality toppings and good flavors .
we started with white peach <UNK> ' s .

will not be recommending them in the future .
appetizer , hot wings , were mediocre at best .
their gold standard burger is legit ... .
i stopped my chewing and stared in utter amazement .
food menu needs a revamp .
short ribs ... very nicely done with great sauce .
meat fell apart at the touch of the fork .
but nonetheless , the food was fantastic .
the temps were different within the bowl .
nowhere is this posted on the menu or signage .
you will be disappointed .
mahi mahi : pretty damn good .
it was even presented in an aesthetic fashion .
had my hair cut twice here .
shower drained was clogged .
all of which made my wife extremely happy .
the rib eye was cooked perfectly at medium rare .
came in around 0 pm .
attended a seat dinner with large event party .

the burgers are pretty damn good .
try the poutine , best i had .
the slaw makes the quebec dog a superior food .
the food was very good .
coffee coco rub was outstanding .
i would n't recommend the halibut .
my <UNK> favorite restaurant in las vegas .
this is my favorite restaurant in the world .
very crispy on the bottom .
not that the quality of the food failed .
cafe fish excelled in this regard .
there is always one desert on the menu .
' ' i asked my wife .
variety , quality , value .
the flavors work extremely well together .
my one problem with this dish ?
the chicken deserved 0 stars .
this review is for the food cart .
very good authentic mexican .
for a mall place this is absolutely great .
do n't forget hot sauce .
i sure love me some fried chicken .
hands down the greatest fried chicken in madison .
i have a rule about mexican restaurants .
my burrito was made to order fairly quickly .
so place is still very clean .
flavor is good though .
the food quality was good and tasty .
i had the holstein beef - slider .
we had some onion rings - good too .
the special combination soup is really good .
for one , their pricing are almost the same .
culinary perfection all the way around .
great og steak house !
no frills no bs .

have n't had a bad meal , period .
enjoy it , embrace it .

best indian food in pittsburgh !
the meats are seasoned perfectly .
everything else here seasoned perfectly .
great place with great wings !
friendly patrons and staff .
i ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread .
i assumed it would be grilled with proper heat .
it was very tasty .
best food i have had in a long time .
the mussels were very fresh and tasted superb .
that ' s how the marinara tasted .
i started with some seafood .
the mac & <UNK> fries are pretty damn good .
good choice of craft brews .
a - rrb - try everything on the menu .
the server was good , made some good recommendations .
it was pretty damn good .
juicy , great skin , white sauce was stellar .
a mixture of all the above ?
had not been there in almost a decade .
been back a dozen times since .
saw some old faces and new .
good looking menu content .
just go patty after patty .
but all in all pretty good .
ordered a couple ohso cocktails .
ordered the steak and fries app .
ate at the restaurant and it was good .
the food was fantastic as well .
have always received exceptional service .
hotel is clean but extremely dated .
the bacon and was quite a bit better .
mon ami gabi is a great dining experience .
the food and service is top notch as well .
even their girlfriends / wives look pretty rough .
the saving grace , though , is the cafe .
mine was about a half pound .
well , guess what ... your meat becomes smaller .
my dish was excellent .
it was easily the best value on the menu .
carbs rarely ever taste this good .
they are very prompt , friendly , and accurate .
` ` what planet are you on , nurse ?
they supposedly make awesome cakes , too .
it arrived in exactly 00 minutes like she said .
it probably contains a half cup of sugar .
big collars that button across - like a flag .
so , i went to the home goods area .
it was not a bad shopping experience .
will shop here another 0 years probably .
lunch is 0.0 stars .
their excellent <UNK> baked in banana leaf .
imo this is the best thing they make .
as a banquet venue , they were below expectations .
what ' s up with that ?
they also make some decent chinese food .
took my mom here who had <UNK> pains .
surprisingly , there were some healthy choices .
very good overall for a buffet .
the food arrived in 00 minutes .
eggs were done just right and pancakes were fluffy .
a few women <UNK> when they walked by .
and other asian families .
i would give that meal a 0.0 rating .
the other half was deep fried crawfish tails .
both are actually good and not overcooked .
the food quality is ok .
had dinner here with the wife and her girlfriends .
overall the food was excellent .
love the dry aging room as you walk in .
steaks cooked exactly as requested .
price in line with decent steakhouses .
the pork fried rice was so-so .
i had a cheesesteak , daughter had a dog .
ronnie ' s is great for breakfast and lunch .
t-bone steak was delicious .
the meat was n't even cooked properly .
go elsewhere if you are looking to party .
i order mine medium rare for the full flavor .
reasonably priced , i ' ll be back .
the furnishings are nice and in good shape .
maid service was always prompt and thorough .
the fish tasted fresh and clean .
some of them are just nicer boxes .
great food , service and value .
new favorite spot in town .

food is without compromise and is always perfect .
the food is unique .

very , very disappointed .
great flavor and great value .
good food and service .
service was great , nice variety and great food .
hidden gem of pittsburgh .
great place to eat !
had a few drinks is all .
great martini ' s here and great vibe .
really enjoy starting the evening here .
stopped in for a pint .
bottom line : take care of the customer !
especially for the quality of food they have .
the full montagu : good .
my wife and i love it !
this is one of my favorite restaurants in charlotte .
our favorite microbrew for sure !
we made reservations before going and were quickly seated .
the fries accompanying the baguette were very good .
the steak fries are highly recommended .
i ordered the onion soup which was very good .
not a big fan of the fries .
the steak was cooked perfectly and tender .
the bathroom is very large with nice toiletries .
this place knows how to do good food .
experiences like this one surely goes against that idea .
bbq that is consistent and tasty .
food is good , plentiful .
the real disappointment was in the steak .
the flavors were just ordinary .
the crepes and this place is very good .
0 sinks were a nice touch too .
prices were reasonable , food was pretty good .
so tender and juicy , with loads of flavor .
the fries were very good .
the dessert bar here is absolutely amazing .
the rooms are nothing special .
want the classic penguin ?
go to the diamond or pinky ' s .
very overpriced for such a small burger .
ohh btw im asian too .
do you want repeat customers ?
i said i was n't interested for now .
it is solid , authentic iced matcha tea .
then we got into the menu think tank .
and no , monta is not one of them .
well , except more eggy .
prices are just fine for ice cream .
the flavor was average at best .
yep , on both visits .
i saw too many flaws today .
on to the positives and new things .
even if your name is mimi .
parking , tour , and garden are all free .
they ' re open from morning until evening .
the cherry was perhaps an accent flavor at best .
oh , and street dogs also does arepas better .
this is a very smartly designed show .
maybe i should have gone with the beef ?
these had better be some really good burgers .
my burger from today .
hot sake : average , i suppose .
it ' s significantly different than i expected .
the shrimp were decent .
i also sampled their slew of chili condiments .
prices appear to be the same for most items .
i brought a friend in today for dinner .
in other words , not the best value .
going off taste , it very likely is .
hopefully , the same holds for your other delights .
moral of the story : try new toppings .
the appetizers are pretty good .
no crab legs or anything with a hard shell .
they do n't offer burgers anymore .
so how did i enjoy the meal overall ?
the presence of yakitori appetizers is pretty awesome .
bacon enoki was my lone yakitori order .
like they say on chopped , transform it .
i ' m a fan .
nothing in the dish was anything special .
finally , you ' ll arrive at the sauces .
this is mainly a critique of the food court .
is very good overall .
the maple bacon french toast was pretty good .
the ingredients are not bad .
same portion size , cheaper , more consistent texture .
i guess i was wrong to lose faith .
nothing fancy in the decor .
i did n't try any of the food .
great recipes , fresh ingredients .
nice amaebi head , but mushy tail .
the sweet shrimp was pretty nice as well .
these rare treats are always nice .
+ the <UNK> tenders are pretty big and juicy .
only three flavors available to sample ?
the food is always great .
the burger is a consistent masterpiece .
guess what i experienced today ?
well , except for desserts .
today was soon enough .
surprised that modest mouse actually made the rotation .
it is n't exactly a traditional italian lasagna .
more on that soon .
probably the most positive part of the experience .
the other two items arrived simultaneously .
my issue here was with the lackluster shoestring fries .
so was the third time the charm ?
i ' ve been here a few times .
and , of course , the notorious menu .
the burger was easily the best part .
flavor profile is n't anything <UNK> .
so , the cheesesteak .
tasty meat , not <UNK> .
i have to start with the fries .
do n't put ketchup on them though .
come back multiple times and try many sauces .
brew tea bar ' s version is better .
the coffee flavor is more prominent here .
definite highlight of the night .
it ' s just a fantastic medley of flavors .
- crispy hen : another of my favorites .
that mayo complements the beet very well .
the bun held the contents just fine .
the complimentary snacking peanuts are as tasty as anywhere .
i would recommend these two dishes for sure .
' ' when she saw my shirt .
- the red velvet is pretty awesome .
you can see them use real fruit as well .
food is a big thing here .
this unexpected surprise bode well for the night .
and the excellent meatballs , of course .
chili ' s has good food .
the french fries are really , really bad .
another difference : they ' re not as good .
what more do you want ?
the blackened chicken was tasty and plentiful .
so what should you order with your beef ?
tastes good until you get really full .
great warm dessert dumpling in a sweet sauce .
the flavors just seemed muted overall .
lastly , some comments about the decor .
light on sweetness , but still enjoyable for me .
really , really good mouth feel .
food : the quality and flavor is great .
get whatever your favorite nigiri is .
i tried the slaw be jo last night .
it is astonishing how much protein i got .
the fries were also ridiculously good .
the fish were all fresh .
desserts were pretty basic .
overall , another fantastic appetizer .
i did try some food .
bite of las vegas delivered on both counts .
it was a real treat .
it ' s not just protein issues here .
and i may have eaten some of these before .
you , too , can be a zombie !
best purely savory thing that i tried here .
what were they thinking ?
i came here hungry and with great expectations .
perfectly cooked beans to boot .
best dishes of the night .
its flavor was lost until eaten alone .
the medium doneness of the patty was acceptable .
moist chicken , nice spices , very sour sauce .
delicious , tender beef .
the pork belly was certainly not crispy as advertised .
prices were reasonable for the portions .
ok , i guess .
it ' s fried and also bursts with flavor .
similar sauce issues , similar passable level of cooking .
also , i would rather avoid the egg roll .
cut them up after cooking .
there are also desserts available near the register .
however , the food was excellent .
i a chicken leg and boy was it crispy .
the place is huge offering 00 flavors .
i added some deli <UNK> from the condiment rack .
onto my brief summary !
suck it up and wait .
but bellagio ' s cheesecake is legitimate .
the gf liked her napoleon .
the bathroom was cool , nothing special .
and you dip them in the special cane sauce .
what do i drown it all down with ?
oh yes , sweet tea .
caniac is like 0 bucks .
sweet and savory with decent syrup .
food was great and prepared perfectly .
wonderful delicious and savory food .
new serenity does it right .
we were seated and served promptly .
the appetizers were great .
bread is big and fresh .
sala thai has some great lunch specials .
i went here last night with my girlfriend .
shout out to the respectable manager , renee .
that along with the mac-n-cheese .
hats off to the owner and cooks .
but echo saved the day .
0 stars because of the great tasting food .
cool atmosphere , mediocre ice cream .
i also got a patty melt .
i had the <UNK> popular carne adovada benedict .
words ca n't describe this dish .
pretty tasty joint that includes fresh oj !
the cinnamon roll was , mm , ok .
high tops , bar & booths are available .
has a cool after taste .
excellent wine and beer choices .
or possibly missing tastebuds .
it ' s common sense and basic good character .
stepped outside for a smoke prior to the show .
quick tip , on a side note .
i ordered the breast of chicken fettuccine .
i doubt you will be disappointed .
one of the best burritos i have ever had .
basic hole in the wall greasy fried food .
she simply could have cared less .
great food and a great location .
good food , great service .

basil and lime has some great dishes .
my wife is thinking about doing their cleanse .

what ' s there not to like ?
as subs shops go i find it ok .
this is what we ate instead .

basic walk-in dining that has a few twists .
first , the food was bland .
plenty of food , but not enough flavor .
a very good sandwhich shop !
anyways , good food .
drinks were refilled promptly .
so definitely a repeat worthy restaurant !
the food in uninspired chinese fast food .
namely the glass does not come out too well .
anyways , not bad overall .
interesting pizzas and some really good appetizers .
strollers and alcohol just seem too judge judy .
portion sizes are more than generous here .
and brother , i had a burger craving .
had a great valentines day dinner with my wife .
absolutely great food is to be found here !

beer is cold , and the service is variable .
they nailed the chili cheese and onion coney dog .
there , i said it .

the foundation of new york flavor is the people .
very good mexican food can be had here .
it lead to some repeats .
they are all the same .
you will not go home hungry .

anyways , same good menu selections , good prices .
best apple store in the country .
appetizers , main dishes , the works .
brought the wife here for a special night out .
the soups are either blah or fantastic though .
these are usually pretty good .
their food quality is on the extreme low side .
the food was one star .
good luck should you shop here .
not a dinner place in my humble opinion .
food ended up being way to salty .
tasty meats , good sauce , and great sides .
ps : the baked beans were good .
damn you and your fantastic service and amazing steaks .
plain and simple and to the point .
burger was cooked to temp perfectly .
let the attack of the blue hairs begin !
and it is your typical buffet decor .
the custard rocks and is amazing .
well , we needed lunch what can i say ?
the roast beef is borderline food product .
avoid avoid avoid this car wash .
good burgers , good shakes , fresh fries .
drinks were not refilled ever .
good stuff here , and nice ambiance .
not a stellar location for applebee ' s .
what really loses me here is the menu .
there is no compelling reason to eat here .
sprouts has fantastic <UNK> meals at very reasonable prices .
our deserts were also impressive all the way around .
i ' m done with ya .
now my experience and thoughts .
the second lady was even worse .
i love their sauce as well .
so you can get whatever drinks you want .
food at the cafe upstairs is decent .
did n't have high expectations .
the steak is even worse .
the steak have a bunch of gristle and tendon .
place was dirty , bathrooms needed a good cleaning .
needed some good food and not regular chain stuff .
ate there today with my girlfriend .
i personally rarely come here specifically to eat .
and definetly get tater tots instead of fries .
had a burger made medium rare .
forgot all sauces to the main course .
but forget all that , the food is bland .
the menu marked this as a spicy dish .
my wife did the same after about 0 bites .
try the steak and eggs .
simple , traditional , tasty .
food is very average .
nice staff , smiling faces .
we just searched yelp for something decent in pittsburgh .
hands-down my favourite indian place in edinburgh .
the lamb <UNK> is amazing .
their bacon is thick and made on-site .
the fillet was cooked perfectly .
the sauce is not very good .
you can dress up your burgers anyway you like .
burgers are small in size but big on taste .
so , i think this place is great .
the best chinese restaurant around .
the empanadas come in a variety of exotic selections .
for my breakfast , i had the eggs benedict .
it gives it character .
both are really good and i highly recommend .
now that dish is winner too .
the restaurant was empty at the time .
the lamb shish kebabs came out aromatic .
beautiful jewelery , great staff , great price .
taste is great , too .

good food , good prices .
very friendly and happy staff .
late night specials are priced right .
food quality is ok .
i bet everything on the menu is superb .
you can watch the asian cooks make your food .
- rrb - but has numerous gimmicky sales .
milk shake machine was broke when we went to .
had n't been there on about a year .
decent selection and helpful salespeople .
took literally an hour for the entrees to arrive .
the only other redeeming factor here was the desserts .
one of the best steaks i have had .
even their fries had a good taste and texture .
the meat is really nothing special here .
steak is n't really that bad .
mmmm ... chocolate banana peanut butter milkshake ... drool .
overall everything was very good quality and very tasty .
possibly the best french toast i ' ve had .
definitely my new favorite cheap eats place in vegas !
their prices are very competitive .
some good sauces to try with fries .
the owner both cooks and serves tables .
the sake was n't bad either .
eat , drink , and be merry my friends .

wine and cheese bars ... to cooking class stations .
extremely friendly service and amazing hot pot .
they also have a great wonton soup .
keep up the great food and the nice smiles .
how much do you think they are worth ?
worst tasting yogurt i have ever eaten .
an excellent atmosphere with cheap , delicious indian food .
there are several dishes that are money .
both of which are sprayed with brown ale .
they usually have a velvet and something on cask .
worst indian buffet in pittsburgh .
the desserts have also been off their game .
0st and last impression are the most important .
one of my go to indian restaurant in montreal .
my wife and i will definitely return .
hostess did a horrendous job seating people .
the flavor was good .
and do n't expect much privacy for your conversation .
well , that ... and the beer selection .

the photos online are pretty well detailed .
i ' m a big fan of that .
i would never return here personally .
the restaurant was very clean and comfortable .
the food was hot and fresh from the oven .
excellent people with great products .
the italian beef is my favorite in town .
get the chicken and biscuit dinner .
i ' m hungry now .
the food here is really good .
the steakhouse buffet is not really a steakhouse .
great service and solid advice on a wine pairing .
stopped in last friday for the lunch buffet .
the burrito was very good and pretty big .
the cinnamon roll was outstanding .
the calamari was cooked perfectly .
went in for breakfast a couple days ago .
food was pretty decent but nothing extraordinary .
so much for my good review of las <UNK> .
basically everything there has been incredibly good .
had the mongolian steak and some house <UNK> .
everything is very bland and tasteless .
the meatballs are pretty good as well .
was n't a bad wash though .
i ' m basing this on past experiences .
everything was really good and served pretty quick .
the service is always great as is the food .
their large is pretty much a medium anywhere else .
same with the inside .
our server amber was fantastic .
both were very good .

the glazed donut i tried was excellent .
the burger was pretty good as well .

the burger alone is easily worth going back .
the bathroom was old , the shower sucks .
the tortilla was homemade .
it ' s just the right size for lunch .
it ' s really good and a good portion .
this will pass for mexican food in arizona ?
the food was mediocre at best .
i have been a frequent diner there myself .
so i assumed that ' s a good sign .
. banana bread in a japanese restaurant ?
the place is an asian fusion themed cafe .
. it ' s a seafood dish .
. small wine list but at a reasonable price .
the fish quality is pretty good .
not like those in bottle .
if i return to arizona .
at this point i just said forget it .
she said sorry nothing we can do .
the answer well they just walked in .
so marginal food and poor service .
the entrees were really second rate .
most of the promised menu was absent .
bread was great , pasta was average .
certain toppings cost extra .
the food was top notch .
spent my girlfriend and i ' s anniversary here .
the meat was cooked perfectly .
this is your typical asian supermarket with great prices .
the cake case had some really old cakes .
fantastic food , good service and very well priced .

the double cheeseburger is actually worth dealing with that .
good food - very tasty and high quality .
this is some good chinese food .
and its open real late .
. its good lean meat and not fatty meat .
very knowledgeable and care about there customers .
makes for some flavor explosions on your tongue .

very quick to replace watch batteries !
the menu is ginormous as was my beer .
tried this place for lunch today .
strawberry sprite is n't bad .
nope just handed me a coke .
eaten here a couple of times now .
definitely a fan of mac ' s .
fairly affordable with many specials .
simple menu makes for good food .
beer and tasty snacks ?
... and some more drinks .
solid place ... and right in my backyard too .
but no expectations and a hungry stomach .
nice and well kept .
only been here a couple of times .
they serve craft brews - lrb - on tap !
did n't really affect the meal though .
tilted kilt in matthews .
this mall is probably the nicest in charlotte .
they basically have you cornered !
absolutely dead inside though .
always have been a fan of <UNK> creek .
- rrb - to go use the restroom .
overall the price and taste are a great combination .
i remember the chinese buffet as well .
stopped here for a quick beer .
it is very clean and has a decent selection .
anyplace that serves breakfast is awesome in my book .
their lunch sandwiches are pretty darn good .
you either like it or hate it .
but i hear their fried liver is the best .
best accidental soup of the day ordering ever .
but the selections here are unique .
not a burger person ?
patio area is pretty killer .
i have n't had a bad burger hear yet .
mattie ' s version is up there for me .
they have a good selection of hallmark cards .
and the bathroom space is meant for large crowds .
went here for lunch the other day .
my overall experience has been great with this store .
i was really surprised by the <UNK> chicken .
anyways ... brews and drinks and good food ... .
much needed review update .
pretty simple set up .
<UNK> , hair grows back .
as is the food .
pretty typical store with friendly faces .
modern meets old in a neighborhood bar feel .

ate here last night .
may try it sometime .
the food is excellent .
that fresh apple cider concoction was amazeballs .
it was very good ... and filling .
penne alla vodka with grilled chicken .
the best breakfast burrito i ' ve ever had .
great food ... and great lunch specials .
last visit i tried the special .
ploy to impulse buy at the register ?
very whimsical and fitting for thier beers .

or even meet with someone .
makes for a unique / modern look .
had a turkey burger and it was great .
great chicken wings and fingers .

over priced for subpar food .
most importantly was how pleased my girlfriend was .
a complete throw away item on the menu .
the lobster pieces were a bit chewy as well .

big servings , wonderful flavor , quality ingredients .
so , food and price-wise , no problem .
the hamburgers are great .
. told u lindsey i yelp you .

the food was excellent as well .
my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed our dinner .

always order special fish taco of the day .
it really is always a good consistent product .
problem with the sparkling water according to the bartender .
from the high quality meat to the delicious buns .
oh and the onion ring are the best .
their happy hour is quite good .
its apple juice for 0 bucks .
the appetizers are very eclectic as well .
good quality food , good mixture .
burgers are all good , nothing great .
all the menu items are tasty and never dissapoint .
highly recommended and come hungry .
the food and service are great .
what ' s the difference , right ?
the point is that the ingredients are quite expensive .
the price including my seats shampooed was very reasonable .
let ' s be honest here .
overall , highly recommended .
we had cheese sticks and fried pickles .
great selection , great quality , great atmosphere .
for a buffet this is five stars .
ok food , good atmosphere .
nice restaurant in a nice mall .
000 calories for an individual red velvet cake ?
the menu , too , goes deeper .
grain fed or naturally raised beef ?
can see it really growing into something special .
waitresses wear tight black pants .
i loved this place till all the changes came .
drinks were ok and nothing special with decent price .
the steak frites was very good however .
joyce did an excellent job on my treatment .
friendly staff and great coffees and teas .
. with great service and awesome food .
it made for quite the contrast .
nice tender beef , laid over sweet onion .
- lrb - again , sauced just perfectly .
anyway , it is kind of novel .
downstairs is pretty casual .
it is ` ` voted the best buffet .
where ' d ya get that steak ?
and the price for all the food was just .
do n't waste your time at this store .
always reliable excellent food and service .
great home made food .
try the chicken salad sand .
fish fry is good .
lots stuff on the menu .
several recent visits with poor food and reluctant service .

vdara is like hidden behind the strip .

the irish stew was ok .
an onion ring appetizer kicked off the culinary cornucopia .

and one word of advice .
it was n't simply put there for the fragrance .
the food was just food .
it was quite evident that quality tomatoes were used .
the chicken cutlet was cooked perfectly .
their ribeye was bursting with flavor .
the staff has always been friendly .
maybe try a burrito instead ?
pick one up and smell it .
they also consistently have great ripe avocados .
tender chunks of pork love .
i choose price over size .
maria was a pleasant waitress .
they have it , both fresh and frozen .
wait , get some fries or rings with that .
is it like a big old <UNK> pepper ?
my wife did n't want to eat them .
their dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings .
i agree with my wife .
where ' s the allure ?
my first visit occurred within 00 minutes of closing .
some times the product is absolutely better than others .
a great mixture of tart and smooth .

the chile hollandaise was a nice touch .

those fries should not be heavily salted .
but the food is solid .
- rrb - the sauce was also very impressive .
i really enjoyed the tacos , as well .
great experience , will definitely be coming back .
food - deserving of four stars .
skip dessert was the consensus among my group .
the decor is pretty much impeccable .
wow that ' s good food .
what ' s not to love about this place ?
the drinks were excellent as well .
` ` no firearms or children allowed .
the burgers emerged not long thereafter .
the fries are just plain disappointing .
the hamburger was simply lacking flavor .
casual , relatively affordable and average from most angles .
awesome venus and staff .
the rest of the restaurant experience is horrible .
in fact , the food is actually quite good .
even better are the amazing prices and relaxed atmosphere !
what doughnut store has no doughnuts ?
food is authentic chinese great food .
again the food is awesome very good .
visited on a friday at 00:00 am for lunch .
sauce : pretty ordinary , really .
finally the drinks arrived with the food .
this is an excellent thai / cambodian restaurant .
maybe 00 % full !
fair enough : lots of other choices .
food is mediocre at best .
decent service , good food .
the regional manager tina <UNK> is extremely helpful .
this is our goto semi quick mexican food .
went here last night during their soft opening .

this bothered me enough to leave this review .
my wife has never had a more juicy burger .
looks like they have a large menu .
i ordered a meal online through their website .
room was very small with boring decor .
wife and i had dinner on our anniversary .
reminiscent of craft steak .
desserts : tasty if not terribly interesting ice creams .
toasted marshmallow was a standout .
stepped into this place and it was quite interesting .
yakitori chicken was ok , nothing special .
ate half of it and lost my appetite .
everything that was ordered satisfied my taste buds .
nothing that would stop me from eating here again .
it ' s texture and flavor are unmatched .
the corn and potatoes were quite good .
the bread that preceded the meal was excellent too .
ladies mostly wore sexy short dresses and high heels .
the burgers are always great and fresh tasting .
even a 0.00 charge for a tall cocktail .
but the food gets a 0 out of 0 .
always very friendly and willing to help .
i ca n't say that they are consistent though .
great food , pleasant atmosphere .
great food , highly recommended .
my wife had the mahi-mahi - amazing flavor !
wife had the grilled salmon .

not time worthy at all .
. the pastries are a bit pricy though .
been coming here for years .
the coffee is excellent and roasted in house .
do n't be fooled by the slightly sketchy exterior .
they make guacamole right next to the table .
your horchata is delicious as is the watermelon lemonade .
this place is right next to my house .
too bad they no longer serve breakfast frybread .

they have a better selection than their chief competitor .
pizza here is sliced into squares .
overall excellent food and service .
the salmon was great portion size and tasteful .
still , i recommend the indian beer instead .
the biggest plus to this cafe is location .
go for the standard chairs or booths instead .
the best indian restaurant in town .
customers have other choices .
that shows your food quality standards have fallen .
food coma coming on !
a must when visiting charlotte .
the food is good and reasonably priced .
the chicken was overly spicy and dry .
we were seated and drink orders were taken immediately .

one exception is the pot stickers .

nan and byron ' s is a great spot .
the bloody mary was nothing special .
there are chinese , japanese , and american options .

very good price for how much food you receive .
the hashbrowns will have anyone coming back for more .
my greek stuffed hamburger steak was like 0.00 .
the country style steak is always two little pieces .
the side portion sizes are quite small too .
it was also very tasty .
both meals were very , very good .
the side orders are quite high .
a typical 00 ' s diner setting .
just had breakfast here for the 0st time .
best ice cream in phoenix , no doubt .
strawberry shirt cake and mint chocolate chip were best .
really i ate $ 00 worth .
coconut <UNK> were excellent as well .

great food and a great selection of craft brew .
hot mind you but just dripping .
not to shabby but do have some complaints .
they were very good .
still one of the best milkshake collections around .
could have used a bit more sauce .
each bite would turn to powder in your mouth .
other than that it is your typical chinese buffet .
good flavor with plenty to select from .

the beers here are way upper upper top shelf .
food is also very good .

not worth the premium prices and bad onion rings .
but this should not happen most visits .
0.00 / 0.00 breakfast special is a great deal .

southwest vegas really has plenty of hidden treasures .
from my whole experience , 0 stars overall baby !

the produce is pretty legit .
portion size was perfect .

salads are a joke .
very few dishes are under 0000 calories .
random selections provided by the chef .
the banchan selection is quite good too .
maybe consider a barn in iowa ?
not oily , but had a baked in taste .
perhaps had a bit too much garlic .
do n't bother with the menu .
i ` ` murdered ' ' my soup .
three things that make up a perfect sunday .
all were very well-prepared .
may i have your attention please ?
there are no grills on the table .
not too tight , not perfect .
the sandwiches are spot on here .
the vitamin section is completely disorganized .
blends well with any sandwich .
my standards are high .
easy to navigate , as are most sprouts stores .
google it for yourself .
the aroma and <UNK> from the exotic product .
thank ' s for everything see ' s candies .
she suggested this place .
you will get a little sloppy afterwards .
a bar that never closes ... and its comfortable .
so in full disclosure , i write this review .
they are fairly consistent .
this jamba juice was pretty cool .
or a cold winter night .
$ 00 - $ 00 cocktails .
being a zombie would take some sort of miracle .
planned to eat in but was given to-go boxes .
- - the iced tea is bomb .
the ugly : my fat belly .
i ' ve been here a few times .
look for some craft beer .
maybe some dogfish head or stone .
- - the liquor selection is amazing .
high who secretly <UNK> you because you were fat .
if your teeth are rank , make it happen .
miss arizona 0000 eats here .
she was pissed when the doc denied her .

a lot of the product tends to be old .
or mrs . n . over and out .
the juices are awesome and creative .
food is quite good too .
you want a solid meal ... come here .
opened up back in august .
not necessarily the good kind .
the decor , the led lighting , the chandelier .
would you dress like this to a nice restaurant ?
less idiots showing up at the door .
the cupcakes reminded me of the <UNK> album pop .
food , very good .
do n't come here looking to socialize .
drinking fountains now dispense ice cold water .
came out here with some friends last night .
portion size was fantastic , as always .
the garlic potatoes and the beans were a hit .
i usually need a grilled chicken breast of sorts .
you may want to take some home .
good luck finding a seat somewhere .
holy <UNK> , these are amazing .
you should probably do your homework beforehand .
the redeeming factor was the meat .
the selection is quite good .
i go for the personal experience .
your own sandwich will taste better .
write your next novel here .
you ' ll thank me .
i ' m a friend for life .

i had a love hate relationship with this store .
everything from your mass domestics , to some craft .

the pizza itself is fairly basic .
bring out the inner korean in you .
the brick oven is the star of this place .
the winner of the three was the margherita .
the rosa was unique , and also delicious .

giving it four stars based on the drink specials .
from the outside it just looks like a barn .
the vietnamese donkey is an amazing cocktail .
do you not want me to buy your product ?

unless it ' s your mom .
it was more like a religious experience .
now , a somewhat dinner review .
and she wanted beer .
what the hell is angel paper ?
appetizers , entrees , charcuterie ... anything .
not necessarily the healthiest .
all in all ... good times , good food .
no need to dress up .

i was already in their system .
i ' m not always in a carnivorous mood .
ok , revisiting this review after several months .
you will have a great time .
pulled turkey , cranberry sauce , stuffing and mayo .
and again , try the cuban wrap .
all the food looked fucking miserable .
this place is a joke .
a night worthy of a celebration if you will .
the greeter even gave us a menu to browse .
you will be a happy soul .
some advice if you are unfamiliar .
you will be stuffed afterwards .
they are bursting out of their dress shirts .
fancy fire at the entrance .
killer lighting throughout the restaurant .
the sauce , the shrimp , the awesome .
pale , lacks flavor ?
positives : crust was perfect and crispy .
totally looks like little italy inside .
then you settled for your next door neighbor ?
the toppings bar is almost always clean .
the seasonal flavors like <UNK> , are awesome .
i had a piece of shit blackberry .
i was born during last carter year .

the chicken fingers were decent .
all around , my new favorite gas station .

tip : avoid the ridiculous mini-bar prices .
food is not the same as it was .
recipes are different with new ownership .
the dishes tended to be on the small size .
the dumplings felt really heavy and very doughy .
some of the dumplings had hardly any filling in .
the fish balls in chinese sauce was horrible .
also the roasted honey carrots were something else .
the grilled octopus is very tender .
all appetizers were very good .
they need to switch from breast to dark meat .
i would not recommend anybody eat here .
ten min later asked again .
their fresh hot salsa required no additional <UNK> .

perhaps the best fried fish anywhere .
nice cozy , dark space .
