i highly recommend aces & ales if your in vegas
i had two <UNK> of fantastic pinot .
this place just gets it .
great local place for moon valley .
congrats to joe and <UNK> for another great concept .
this week the special was fried lobster and chips .
fuego is a good time tex-mex street food place .
<UNK> are absolutely spot on .
my favourite dish was shrimp tempura roll .
otherwise they would surely have got only one star .
pizzas tasted way below average .
borders were n't crunchy , but really doughy .
what an enjoyable experience .
their avacado blows my mind .
no one faces the bar which is odd .
these sorts of places are relative .
experience was better than expected .
would highly suggest doing this with a small group .
how can a sandwich joint not have mayo .
this place is a front for the russian mob .
that was not the case here .
wife and kids enjoyed the <UNK> .
the tiramisu was also very good .
the menu looked impressive with very reasonable prices .
the waiter was very friendly .
the waiter moved us to another table .
two of the kids split the ribs .
had salami and mushroom pizza .
had a medium cheese pizza .
service - sub par .
the service should match .
skip desert as well .
not a mochi fan , but my wife is .
i liked this place better than yama sushi .
well reviewed for good reason .
they all had the same strategy .
does the ac / heater work ?
does the sliding door to the balcony work ?
- rrb - old-school tube tv .
<UNK> waiting after 00 minutes .
the sides however were entirely delightful .
not sure if i ' ll be back .
overall , good but not special .
great place and reasonable prices .
also <UNK> are not badly priced .
for $ 000.00 you ca n't beat it .
. you wo n't like this place .
always tried over the counter <UNK> .
i had one <UNK> with me .
i called this place .
. dr logan answers to the phone .

$ 00 and i was done .
the service is top and on their game .
the service is spot on with what i expect .
no <UNK> , just doing it right .
the variety of music was a pleasant surprise .
you cant go wrong with <UNK> .
the decor is <UNK> .
the old fashioned kind you attach to a hose .
a real imax theatre , not just named one .
brake masters is not a rip off .
i feel very confident in their skill and honesty .
strange thing goin on with pricing .
thats kind of deceiving to potential new customers .
the old stuff is n't noticed as easily .
local management changes all the time .
tempe is still the neglected one .
that was about about 0:00 .
there ' s plenty of staff on hand .
an outdoor table is a must .
. this is a smokers paradise .
a few hours later a supervisor called .
got hosed on my award item .
i will never ever contract with cox again .
this club has self checkout .
scan your card and grab a hand held .
it has some issues on a daily basis .
if you ' re middle aged , good luck .
signage : poor to non existent .
years and years of poor planning .
in serious need of a make over .
a better produce section than main & alma school .
the food is great .
why the number sign then ?
just bizarre i love this place .
some sections are a bit cramped though .
similar concept time warp banking .
like banking in the early ' 00s .
excellent meat and produce department .
it cramped and this is not it .
this is like <UNK> good .
. # 0 buffet in vegas .
lobster corn chowder was nice but kinda salty .
outer guys you are the front line .

for 0 guys , that was plenty .
the bruce lee of boba drinks .
avoid this tourist trap at all costs .
the food is amazing and the prices unbelievable .
and their charges were more than reasonable .
drink prices and entry <UNK> reasonable .
nothing had changed at all .
this is one odd little neighborhood diner .
the restaurant also doubles as a bar .
not a bad place , not stellar either .
$ 00 after tip .
yes , the poutine was a letdown .
the bahn mi dog however , was outstanding .
not the easiest place to get to .
they take us dollars at par .
classic greasy spoon in the <UNK> .
there ' s a reason for this .
<UNK> frozen fries and <UNK> cheese curds .
the gravy is a power , but sufficiently spicy .
or have good bbq .
at 0pm on a tuesday .
overall , it was a decent burger .
not a $ 00 cheeseburger .
what do you know about poutine ?
the poutine was just as described .
the poutine is a dissapointment .
the rooms were fine but minimal .
interesting <UNK> in <UNK> .
the place has the typical montreal chinatown look .
the bill was moderate .
a good broth takes a long time .
we had two full <UNK> boxes .
one star knocked off for the service .
not bad , not good , but not memorable .
the place itself is very simple .
- rrb - , <UNK> screamed attitude .
the ribs were fall off the bone .
you never go to verdun .
both fulfill the basic requirements .
$ 0 with taxes for the one pictured above .
yep , your best bet in this international terminal .
english is a beautiful language .
just expect cheap both ways .
this places does it right in the details .
it is very good .
cheese : cheddar cheese curds .
big props for the orange glazed donut also .
it ' s really two separate places .
the shrimp and vegetables meal was average .
if you feel like experimenting , why not .
the good + 0 for the giant poutine .
montreal pool room is an institution .
any place would be better than here .
00hr spot in the sls hotel .
i had the chicken fajitas and el mayor margarita .
service is a little slow but overall good experience .
. not a lot of traffic at all .
went well with a good guinness .
cool little spot to pop in when in charlotte .
the beer was a tad <UNK> .
the seasoning was unbelievable .
tons of beers of tap as well .
<UNK> come back when in charlotte .
cool bar , and nice <UNK> .
really nice whole foods location .
price is moderate to high .
overall it was a good meal .
cool hotel right in the heart of the epicenter .
so factor that into your stay .
seriously this place is trying to scam people .
there are other options .
get yourself together toby .
every other one was a toby keith video .
join the rest of the 00st century vegas .
where the hell is your swimming pool ?
things i liked about harrah ' s : 0 .
$ 0.00 heineken keg cans in the lobby store .
$ 0 miller lite .
order him a sage fried chicken and bacon waffles .
or maybe it ' s just a nice place .
this place appears that it could be pretty cool .
that shit was choking me all night .
crispy and friggin good .
never had any issues with maintenance or noise .
good omelet ' s and great <UNK> .
what more could you ask for ?
im a huge fan of <UNK> .
<UNK> is the real deal .
no , not <UNK> : montreal .
do n't waist your time .
overpriced , low end italian food .
poor , i attentive wait staff .
succeeds as a tourist trap !
i would give them a zero if i could .
plus the owner is a dick .
the sides are solid too .
just a great all around experience .
in a mostly empty dining room .
not the case here .
all in all distinctly average with slow service .
its a bit expensive but its an event .
small store but informative staff .
the new ownership has really made great improvements .
very poor quality in both the rolls and sashimi .
great atmosphere , even better food .
from this experience , i think it deserves it .
they get one star for having a beautiful casino .
similar concept to pie <UNK> but much better .
nice to have another good west side lunch spot .
i ' m very surprised by the reviews .
it was a wide array of choices .
what a great place .
while watching a nice flat screen tv .
the patio is a blast .
all the above sucked ... enough said .
plus they ' re pretty much racist .
def be going there again .
excellent , same-day service .
rob , with city wide was fantastic !
thank you rob and city wide !
good for the kids food is ok .
the quality has crashed .
what a bunch of clowns !
what a great guy , really made the night !
the service was kind of mixed .
the dip was a mistake , do n't order .
chips and guacamole were really good .
but overall excellent food , service and ambience .
the hash browns were good .
so one is plenty for a smaller stomach .
looking for something completely different well here it is .
not worth it at all .
initial entry into the restaurant <UNK> you .
very attentive , friendly , and professional staff .
the food was very impressive .
the brisket was on par with <UNK> .
thumbs up to the food and the staff .
i got the pulled pork and beef brisket .
the bbq sauce was like ketchup .
it says voted best bbq in vegas .

they called all of this ` normal ' .
had the carnitas burrito and rolled tacos .
<UNK> was attentive , humorous and knowledgeable .
we actually went two nights in a row .
can not beat this for the money !
super slow even though the place was not busy .
. if your are drunk they will get you .
. but after reading some of the reviews .
. i was like ok lets do it ... .
one wagyu sirloin and one wagyu ribeye .
i got a sirloin and eggs for breakfast .
definitely keeps you occupied while awaiting your food .
extra points for having <UNK> on tap .
you ' ll thank me later .
you want to know the meaning of life ?
pretty solid place that a lot of people frequent .
y ' all are the real <UNK> .
is it be the best pizza on earth ?
you ' ll thank me later .
it ' s four peaks .
<UNK> is my joint .
i ' ll go here for life .
one of the few legit <UNK> around .
one of a kind around here .
why would someone take that upon themselves ?
this was a mistake .
this place truly is as good as it gets .
the safety video aside , everything went fairly smooth .
not a single <UNK> <UNK> on the ground .
what a complete shotgun shooting park !
great job clark county .
now i am getting pissed .
what can you say about dicks ?
good selection of beers and always a killer band .
most establishments do not stock this top shelf bourbon .
for me , this is a good thing .
a fun atmosphere and good food at great prices .
the view itself brings two stars to the table .
the owners did a terrific job with decor .
bacon night is for sure a great attraction .
central phoenix ' s living room .
great diverse cross section of he city .
come here for the excellent bottled beer selection .
very quick service for the middle of the afternoon .
looks like it could be lively in the evening .
service was very friendly .
they advertise the most beers on tap in town .
$ 0 mexican beers on sunday night .

wit wiz is where it ' s at .
the sunday bbq was incredible .
peace and i ' m out .
smash cold stone on the reg yo .
who cares , that ' s a good sign .
as in legit and amazingly good .

# 00 or # 00 .
location is off the strip but worth the trip .
a typical hotel cafe .
now for the food .
overall the cafe was a really nice place .
it can use an improvement please .
enjoy your time there and cheers !
and that ' s what omakase is all about .
the broccoli with beef was probably the best tasting .
and finally the beer was cold and refreshing .
i should have gone to panda express .
for us , nothing beats a free comp meal .
and the manager on duty was not nice either .
i dealt with louis / lewis when was awesome .
00 minutes later no one has shown up .
i called again and was told the same thing .
no compensation , no follow up .
i ' ve heard mgm has great properties too .
one of the great gems off the strip .
who would try to <UNK> the wheel with pizza ?
really bad first time experience here .
there broth was sooooooooo good .
i had the large bowl # 0 .
it is a hip trendy place .
its a family ran establishment .

may 00th 0000 was there first day of business .
on both visits they were fast and very friendly .
the drive through service was extremely slow .
but give it a try if you like chipotle .
what ' s not to like .
you can at least be sure of consistent service .

the location is right across from the mandalay bay .
the staff at this location changes constantly .
i have only three words for this place .
the place is always way to loud .

yeah after 00 mins in this hole i left .
in need of some serious renovations .

the price is decent .
i probably would go there again .
very impressive condo style .
perfect location on the strip .
really good hotel for the price .

this place is awesome .
their drinks are cheap and bartenders awesome .
it was very good .
<UNK> selection , but made fresh .

very impressive for a old renovated hotel .
most standards for hotels were standard here .
room service was good , cheap , fast .
sunday night , its 00pm .
nothing but a bunch of ratchet people .
sunday was more of a nice local crowd .
this place is kind of depressing .
they actually fight with real swords and weapons .

it lay picked over and <UNK> .
just good affordable chinese place close the my house .
always fast and friendly as well .
this place is just really really good .
that is n't an insult .
the 00s concrete style is a nice <UNK> .
the food and the accommodations were great .
that is the real draw of this place .
it ' s everyday from 00-0 : 00 .
it helps that the crust is really quite good .
can you guess where this is heading ?
lots of gravy , almost a boiled beef texture .
the 0.00 <UNK> really exist anymore .
do n't stop here .
absolute joke of a hotel with completely ignorant staff .
avoid this place at all costs .
in fact ... nope nobody ever has .
the food is great .
am sure this place is quite popular for <UNK> .
barely three tables were occupied .

not as long a wait as i was expecting .

burnt hot dogs and 0 bathroom on the course .
holes pulled out on the greens .
will never golf here again .
you ' ll be made to feel at home .
it is spartan but clean .
it ' s a cultural thing .
this place has authentic szechwan cuisine .
grimaldi ' s crust was descent .
grimaldi ' s popularity puzzles me .
the service was excellent .
liberty market deserves its 0 to 0 star rating .
tiny @user $ 00 bucks .
in a word lousy .
very well put together for take out .
had all the required utensils etc . .
luigi ' s presence is still felt here .
the selection is outstanding , including their own .
one of the best in the country .

a pretty bad place altogether .
$ 0 for a sandwich only .

the hawaiian bbq place here previously rocked .
maybe your customer service needs some looking into .
either way it fails miserably .
the brisket nachos are a great appetizer .
come before 0 to beat the rush .
they charge per box per room .
cox was 000 times better .
remember cash is the only form of payment accepted .
keep it up guys .
the pineapple fried rice is another great dish .
they are efficient and seem do a great job .
to me this does n't seem like good business .
these guys always do a great job .

went today and was greeted by the friendly staff .
overall a great bbq joint .
overall solid food and service .
the table side guacamole is really good .
slots at the bar but never played .
this is a good little go to lunch spot .

one star is too many .
either do the hotel staff .
easily 00 % more them other places .
portions are way smaller than other sam woo .

steak and ale , shepards and chicken pot .
that ' s the 0 stars fantastic .
only negative ordered makers mark on the rocks .
the bars are staffed with expert mixologists .

a good break from the craps table .
this place has talent .
the service at world of beer is terrible .
their loyalty card is also spendy .
management does n't resolve your issue 0 .
this is just some dive waiting to be <UNK> .
looks like <UNK> jack , not sure exactly .
great guys over here .
i go here very time im on the strip .
san tan brewery brews the best beer in town .
bad things : many broken appliances / lights .
just charging my phone turns into a nightmare .
forget having clean bed sheets .
there is a major problem with pests here .
i get food here often .
the place is nice and clean .
i like the traditional queso con <UNK> .
randomly stumbled upon this place .
the servings where big and the prices where cheap .
this is a nice little place .
good place for a somewhat quick bite to eat .
well worth the price and wait , at times .
its like playing russian roulette .
this place well deserves the 0 stars .
the employee who took our order was extremely <UNK> .
this place made panda express seem like fine dinning .
ok now that i ' ve said that .
the guy took my number and address down .
oh and the aquarium had penguins .
the service is prompt and friendly .
the pizza is mediocre at best .
as i said , mediocre at best .
not too expensive and better than eating at subway .
all and all it was a decent lunch .
00 cents a wing with purchase of drink .
nice little place with decently good service .
this place is great .
you wont be disappointed .
large selection of beer awesome atmosphere live music !

this guy is awesome .
i love you <UNK> - a guy !
they where surprisingly good .
do n't use these guys .
i see no reason to go back .
have been going to for awhile now .
got up and left .
way to go village inn .
so that means nothing to us .
the staff is fair .
the owner is a really nice guy .
i also buy all my beer mugs there .
trying being the key word .
this , in contrast to the local volvo dealerships .
lived up to the hype .
so many bad reviews about cox .
their so-called internet technical assistance is pretty useless .
most likely they will give it to you .
also , certain wines and beers also heavily discounted .
speaking of the service , it was excellent .
the atmosphere is unique .
they also provide a sweet stainless steel growler option .
while driving through town this place caught my eye .
just opened following winter over <UNK> .
course played surprisingly well .
tees and fairways were in good shape .
the rough was a golf ball eating monster .
would certainly play again .
bad pun but this place really does rock .
what ' s not to like here .
they cost a few <UNK> but welcome to vegas .
<UNK> is an awesome bartender !
the room felt old and in need of renovation .
four words : peanut butter crunch burger .
good hotel in a perfect mid strip location .
fun place with good food and great bowling .
they were n't too fatty or tough .
the highlights were the roast beef and bbq ribs .
review for casino / bar only .
a bit overpriced but worth checking out .
the rice and black beans were also pretty good .
large casino with good drink service also .
if so , they still do it right here .
this place is worth checking out on the strip .
simple menu , excellent food , great prices !
comfortable and clean hotel with a very friendly staff .
- rrb - are considerably more expensive .
what else do you need ?
hm ... am i missing something here ?
he allowed himself the business man special .
this place is just great .
it just was calling out to me .
he was a character and had a great personality .
rip off and way over rated .
way too enamored by fame of the owner .
not disclosed at booking .
booked hotwire for $ 00 for two queen suite .
you wo n't regret it .
this place is unfortunately very disappointing .
the bug was still better than this .
keep up the good work .
quite simply , this restaurant is an institution .
the <UNK> was overloaded with peppers and very bland .
please someone give them the number to bar rescue .
service was very cordial as well .
the mains were quail served on an iceberg salad .
superb , yet junky .
the rooms are ok .
the amenities are a good balance .
it is the worst .
the housekeeping staff are terrible .
this is my first <UNK> yelp !
it was just that good .
also it ' s in the middle of nowhere .
what a great find .
the beer should come in a bigger mug .
the rating is based upon last 0 visits .
save your money and take a taxi .
00 bucks for the total bill .
a high tech holiday .
the coffee was standard diner stuff .
good thickness on crust .
they let people in with hats and shorts .
filing a bbb complaint too .
wow ! ! this place is great .
guy serving you the beer super friendly .
tours of the brewery available .
the people working are nice and courteous .
service is not bad just a little different .
draft mexican beer selection is great .
i first had <UNK> libre from the food truck .
they have tacos here too .
this is the harrah ' s casino buffet .
we went there on a sunday night .
so basically : this auto shop is scam central .
do n't let this happen to you .
possibly the best fish tacos in town .
this place is amazing .
the food is great .
definitely not the place for a bachelor party .
venue and stage is excellent .
had the bone-in ny strip .
man what a great place .
everything is special from the teriyaki to the <UNK> .
this is no alternative to bonsai .
recently stopped in phoenix ' s newest sushi restaurant .
by 000 the place was filled .
surprisingly light considering it was deep fried .
0.0 overall for price , taste , and service .
filing with bbb & anyone that will listen .
great location and an awesome selection of beers .
nothing else needs to be said .
cozy little cafe in park road shopping plaza .
i was completely unimpressed by their <UNK> crust .
absolutely loved the furniture and design wing .
beer selection seemed ok , but not particularly vast .
service was predictably , <UNK> slow .
my word , this place is outstanding .
street parking is ample .
mediocrity , thy name is gordon .
i found the beer menu surprisingly limited and uninspired .
' ' thanks , buddy .
fitness center was good , but not great .
not sure why others are down on this place .
nice interior with an expansive bar .
they ' re freakin ' unbelievable .
many mentioned the portions were large here .
ca n't give less than 0 star .
poor service gouged for coffee , water and wifi .
found this place on <UNK> .
; - rrb - these guys are great !
usually sushi here is good .
i ' m like alright great .
one star does not do this place justice .
. panda express is fine dining compared to this .
. do n't really know where exactly to start .
takes me back east .
this is definitely not your dads barbershop .
get me in and get me out please .
two problems with this location .
jack in the box or del taco .
friendly staff and good environment .
the atmosphere was very sophisticated .
a simple move turned out to be a nightmare .
. what a joke .
staff was horribly inattentive .
and mert ' s did not disappoint .
fried catfish - it was cooked and breaded perfectly .
one in that <UNK> is graze .
i studied here once upon a time .
the only flavor detected was that of roasted corn .
i was equally disappointed in the tacos i ordered .
it was very good .
the rooms here are superb .
spacious , well done - - simply beautiful .
surprisingly , everything else at the venetian is sub-par .
the dry aged bone-in ribeye was outstanding .
a lot of experience was <UNK> by the service .
avoid this place all together .
the wave relaxation area had several <UNK> chairs .
- the ac is so-so .
- there ' s no wireless internet .
the pizza crust is quite thin and crispy .
place looks old cheap and dirty .
very nice friendly service .
big portions tried it like four or five times .
i reluctantly give these guys 0 stars .
it irked me as the <UNK> never stopped .
totally progressive in their approach .
most impressive was the complexity of their single origin .
these guys are official .
one of the experiences in phoenix .
always a great place for breakfast in the morning .
go early to avoid the long line wait though .
i recommend trying the place .
never been to an irish bar ?
this is an irish bar .
but ca n't make this stuff up .
however this experience was much less than good .
i rented from the las vegas airport location .
the angus short ribs are to die for .
the filling was decent , but not great .
steven j . was at my house before 0am .
just like when i was a kid in ny .
probably because it was old and not made properly .
' ' with an attitude .
if they have them made .
today i received two nest <UNK> in the mail .
plus the garbage was overflowing .
nice place , quiet with good music .
but just open after 0:00 pm .
you can not beat the $ 00.00 lunch special .
the service and atmosphere are also excellent .
i believe towards the strip .
i could see the hooters casino from our room .
as well as walking around the casino .
and this was at 0:00 pm .
the price was very fair .
thank you , craig and your polite team .
long lines in check in and check out .
internet wifi was $ 00 for 00 minutes .
ripoff like internet in rooms .
not good for five star hotel !
do yourself a favor and visit detroit coney grill .
do n't come here with groups larger than six .
the fish tacos are top-notch .
this is a review of the chai .
easily some of the best donuts in the valley .
these are quality donuts , especially for their price !
but asking for help is kinda hit-or-miss as well .
your mileage may vary .
the sea bass just melted in the mouth .
it seemed to be designed to encourage <UNK> .
staff just repeated ` ` call your bank .
no such amenities here .
here is a video of the experience : http://url
should be zero stars .
do n't make the 00k mistake i made .
fair is stretching it .
this place is horrible .
the deep dish was the best .
fish dishes are excellent .
good selection of india beer .
staff is very good .
well worth a trip .
the service sucks and the food is worse .
the service started out ok at the bar .
the baked <UNK> was cold as was the veggies .
0 in our party .
no wonder this place is empty .
their customer service is piss poor .
the pork and beans are outstanding .
<UNK> the worst mcdonald ' s there ' s .
great <UNK> , and a wide selection of juices .
the beef stir was bland with poor presentation .
also , why were there <UNK> stems ?
one of many pho places in chinatown .
it is quite dry as well .
very cheerful japanese music .
five ramens and four sides to choose from .
the ramen was well presented .
does not compare to toronto or new york .
where is a good ramen place in montreal ?
the wings are very good .
great sandwiches , the # 00 is my fav .
give it a try you will not be disappointed .
<UNK> salad very good .
steven is the head sushi chef .
the bartender / barista suggested the yelp deal .
the salsa bar has some tasty choices .
they have rotating food trucks .
mr . flores was very helpful and knowledgeable .
i need also found him to be very honest .
half off of pizzas on monday .
they also have an excellent salmon burger .
no trip is complete without horchata .
the service was quite bad here .
service was quick and efficient and quite friendly .
so , what exactly is <UNK> ?
was it well made ?
the <UNK> experience was bland .
- service is extremely friendly and quick .
unable to park their <UNK> properly .
staff was competent and helpful .
try it with their jack bbq sauce !
price : quality is rarely cheap in montreal .
it ' s a completely different and mediocre experience .
their <UNK> soups is very good .
this review is dated but must be read .
this is golden folks .
what does he do ?
it was very good but where are the sides ?
mind you this is a $ 00 breakfast .
get on with it <UNK> , upgrade your stuff .
no <UNK> but worth mentioning .
the arancini balls are very very good .
service is quick and friendly .
is it still worth it ?
but hey , the rides are fun !
all for a 0 minute ride .
this place is just too small .
00 minutes for the newest ride .
0 to 00 minutes .
there are two shows to attend .
so , what is the verdict ?
they did n't survive .
to me it irritates me .
everything is ... well mustache related and looked good .
oh and the free wifi password is amazing .
burgers , fries , onion rings , pizza .
everything was decent but nothing stood out for me .
once again , a lot of options are available .
all hail <UNK> fruits !
the bad : the saganaki felt completely off .
it was decent but quite forgettable .
the tiramisu simply was n't for me .
what really caught my attention ?
the 00 + screens all over the place .
are you reading this cage of sports ?
the <UNK> was about average however .
probably the best service i can possibly get .
a true 0 star place .
probably the best <UNK> in the montreal area .
biggest with the <UNK> of selections .
it ' s was good , sadly not excellent .
as good as bacon usually is .
what an excellent idea .
as in , bigger than the hoagie itself ... .
the foot traffic in this place is ridiculous .
the <UNK> of fries was very good as well .
you leave with battle <UNK> on your bum bum .
the potato chip fries however were totally 0 stars .
huge jukebox in the middle of the restaurant .
the root beer was ridiculous .
at least those i stole from his plate .
service : the service was solid .
- food was prompt , no waiting .
- the imperial rolls were fantastic .
simply not the best general tao i ate .
all in all , very average experience .
it simply was n't comfortable beyond 00-00 minutes .
the <UNK> is about average .
an unimaginative slab of meat was served .
the brisket meat was good though .
the price tag is somewhat expensive for poutine .
probably the best <UNK> in the montreal area .
biggest with the <UNK> of selections .
they called earlier in the day to confirm .
the pager rang at 0:00 .
not great , good .
so let ' s recap this .
my guess would be for the empanadas !
- the place is very aesthetically pleasing .
water will be fine .
the selection is amazing in both english and french .
it was as fun as it sounds !
the <UNK> was acceptable .
anywhere between 0 to 0 is great .
meh : - the sushi is below average .
- the service was neither good , nor bad .
all was expertly done .
but leave the burger and root beer along please .
the <UNK> is good and the service was solid .
the bbq sauce was excellent .
overall , an excellent meal for $ 00 .
those minutes that went by ?
the yelpers who recommended this were absolutely correct .
all in all , it was an ok experience .
they are quick and eager to help .
something i never do elsewhere .
awesome place , totally recommend .
if you like to wheel and deal .
what kind of supervision is my kid getting ?
the service was quick and efficient .
the place is usually pretty busy for lunch .
this is where the problem lies .
ny steak for $ 00 ?
really ? ? what a rip-off .
settled for something less and still felt ripped off .
i was the only non-asian in the place .
got the general tao and the broccoli beef .
the general tao is good , nothing great however .
the broccoli beef was good .
this is the place to go to in laval .
no qualms with that .
how is this even possible ?
had to heat it up .
what did i actually get ?
the service was attentive and on point .
the price tag was <UNK> average .
the <UNK> is exceptional .
the <UNK> is about average and worth it .
the service was decent as well .
there is close to 00 beers on tap .
you ' re wasting your time .
once your questions are answered , order away .
the lunch menu was n't overly exciting .
the staff was friendly and cost very reasonable .
price tag is high .
there was simply no effort to get them right !
service : this is where things complicated .
this is putting it mildly .
expect to pay 00 $ for two people .
the service was abysmal .
service was quick and efficient .
this is the place .
the tzatziki is good , greek sausages excellent .
greek salad is good .
italian pizza and gelato ?
why are you still reading this review ?
bookmark it and experience this yourself .
to get the same issue once again .
- i went with their sirloin hibachi steak .
my palate was quite appreciative .
- the service was relatively quick and attentive .
it was attentive with plenty of coffee refills .
price tag a bit more expensive than expected .
the service is about as solid as it gets .
all in all a great start .
' ' this is high praise .
the service was exceptional .
- the tzatziki is fantastic .
- i recommend any lamb dishes they have .
- service is extremely friendly and quick .
- sometimes service is n't up to par .
seating arrangements can be better .
it ' s hit and miss in this regard .
across the board the service was notably good .
the poutine hit all 0 targets it should .
all this for a mere $ 0 .
the gentleman left a very positive impression on me .
first time i ordered two sandwiches .
firstly , the place is very nice and modern .
it ' s no dump .
you better made sure the quality is there .
that ' s an issue .
ended up being in this part of the town .
first thing i noticed ?
all in all very good .
service was quick and friendly .
give me canada ' s blood good sir .
pros : - the garlic sauces were really good .
all in all very good .
my dining experience went as follows .
espresso was very good .
who can blame me , right ?
it was n't terrible but not for me .
all in all a perfect 0 star experience .
the coleslaw was n't for me .
it ' s not even a debate .
nonetheless , i was satisfied .
all in all , a nice place to eat .
<UNK> was notably good as well .
funnel the flow of people going in staff !
their most interesting <UNK> .
why live to 00 ?
however , the ant <UNK> is very cool .
it ' s such an awesome responsibility .
nothing more you ' d find it anywhere else .
yes , they were very good .
the service was lackluster as well .
i already visited this place 0 times .
<UNK> hot dog is a montreal institution .
but how did coco loco stand to its competition ?
a <UNK> amongst many .
why am i reviewing costco ?
this place is huge , it will happen .
i went with the filet mignon and <UNK> sandwiches .
<UNK> is pretty expensive as well .
why live to 00 ?
- music and atmosphere was retro and kinda neat .
plenty of tv screens to watch a game .
la <UNK> e la .
service was on-point and friendly .
was it simple laziness ?
go in for 0-0 things i need .
served quickly and efficiently .
pizza has never been disappointing .
so , how can i contribute further ?
best poutine in town bar none .
service fast and friendly .
the cafe ice cream is <UNK> .
it failed in its challenge ... .
the bill was about average .
how much do new <UNK> pay for it ?
i always seem to have better luck there .
the architecture of the buildings are very european .
coming by metro is long and <UNK> .
there ' s simply not enough of it .
- rrb - and brought it home for bbq .
the ambiance is very nice with attentive staff .
the <UNK> is pretty solid .
was it the way it was done ?
there ' s already plenty of it .
so no complains there .
they were great and complete hits .
my experience was a 0.0 but rounded down .
maybe by then the place will be cleaned better .
good luck on the rest .
the 0 salsas served with the chips are incredible .
went to this location on father ' s day .
the sandwich is so simple .
this place was quite good .
they seemed to ` ` get it right .
they had a great attitude and worked effectively .
. signed a very large american man .
thats the combo , people .
ca n't go wrong .
did not care for the pho .
cooper ' s is a great place to go .
i would highly recommend .
they are by far the best in the valley .
incredible atmosphere and food .
plenty of local and regional <UNK> .
it really does not get better .
thanks bob we had a great time .
go at lunch and it almost half the price .
very helpful staff and pricing is just right .

ahh ted ' s ... where to begin .
there ... hopefully that ' s enough <UNK> .

i would recommend to anyone .

this is the case with mickey ' s dogs .
a gem off the strip , near circus circus .
dont let the looks fool you .
service fast and friendly .
my go to place for great greek food .
see picture for further reference .
nothing really screams reds or indians .
overpriced and their brisket was below average at best .
midwood smokehouse is far better and better priced .
the service here does not match the high prices .
i guess they value profits over customer service .
unfortunately we hired <UNK> movers .
a better name would be southwest <UNK> .
. excellent ambiance <UNK> wine list
very friendly customer service .
cant recommend this place enough .
the place is jamming .
now on to the food .
also very good <UNK> .
started with a chorizo cheese crisp and loved it .
that is what is great about giuseppe ' s .
my <UNK> dishwasher stopped working and needed repair .
the price from the price book : $ 000 .
overall , i would recommend .
by far the best coffee shop in the valley .
their craft beers are decent .
this place has certainly earned my patronage .
all were quite good .
to drink i had a big ol 00oz beer .
washed it all down with a peroni on draft .
these people put in zero effort .
bar none the best coffee in charlotte .
but midwood smokehouse holds its own .
<UNK> efficient and <UNK> consistent .
decently good value for what you get .
try the california chicken blt or the bahn mi .
this is an excellent option for lighter vietnamese fare .
pass it and go to makino down the street .
the food was fantastic .
good high end chinese restaurant on the overpriced side .
highly recommend this place .
disappointing this last time .
me no go anymore .
all three of us <UNK> on our opinions .
actually would give it 0.0 stars .
decent real mexican food with great <UNK> .
the beer is cheap .
none of the food however is outstanding .
thanks again az propane .
if they can double the price they will .
i saw some older negative reviews here .
they ' re not true now .
a lot of tv ' s for sports too .
jay did a great job .
great people all around and quality work .

this place is amazing .
be forewarned about renting from this company in general .
if you can , hit it at lunch .
nowhere else is close .
brought my watch in for repair .
$ 00 and it was finished in 0 week .
that ' s $ 000 / hr .
dim sum in vegas ?

so to replace all 0 tires ?
felt like eating in the <UNK> camp .
i ' m dead serious .
horrible experience with the chef .
scott and his team were honest and professional .
thank you scott and the team at <UNK> .
many thanks to scott and his <UNK> team .
the mad max here is a fantastic blended coffee !
the biggest waste of $ 00 in recent memory .
the servers were surly and disinterested .
place had a good vibe .
i hope they also fix their ice machine .
i was provided this service on oct . 0000 .
the actual windshield replacement was a breeze .
keep up the good work !
today we had an appointment to see the house .
now let ' s talk about service .
they have great selection of <UNK> with great atmosphere .
it hits very well and lasts very long .
they <UNK> the drunk guy out .
worst bar i have ever been to .
the hard part is finding it .
service is always top notch and knowledgeable .
beer is ice cold .
the sushi is fresh .
the hamachi nigiri was three bites .
it is also accompanied by several shops .
the <UNK> was great in this aspect .
0 stars for a 0 star team .
check this place out .
this place seems to be declining in quality .
it is nothing more than a <UNK> time vampire .
stopped here while re <UNK> myself with pittsburgh .
cool place , good beer .
excellent breakfast place off the strip .
busy but minimum waits .
crowded and noisy , but i enjoyed drinking here .
so this is for the buffet only .
the rest of the meal was equally as delicious .
it ' s a very relaxing and enjoyable experience .
this place is cool .
well , damn did i find it this time .
changed channels on the tvs at request .
service was slow but food was decent .
on to the main course - pasties .
the service was extremely slow .
place is well suited for any gathering .
on to the main course - pasties .
pasty recommendation : peppered lamb
this stuff is serious .
i thought they brought me a coke by accident .
that ' s about it .
i ' m not going to <UNK> the joint .
great real ales at good prices .
staff & beer make the place .
the mac and cheese is da bomb !
not a bad find .
pizza is delicious , wings are good .
called back two nights ago and no credit .
what more could you ask for ?
would be great for a party .
service was fast , generally .
there was a small tv showing the news .
but bacchanal still serves quite a feast .
this makes no sense what so ever .
no reason from what i can <UNK> .
this place is amazing .
great spot if you are a hipster .
felt very taken advantage of .
after being told 00 min .
it ended up taking 0 & 0/0 hours .
disappointed that they could deliver on their promises .
thursday night , absolutely disorganized .
sound coming through the radio is fuzzy and inconsistent .
i should have went next door to five guys .
eric again was not willing to help .
word of advice ... go early .
the conversion was nicely done .
service was great ; just what i expected .
ca n't go wrong .
great service , awesome dining experience .
0.0 rounds up to 0 stars .
go else where and thank me later .
is this a <UNK> fever dream ?
it ' s the <UNK> international airport .
the ravioli was absolutely amazing .
a las vegas local restaurant for many years .
the food was outstanding , service impeccable !
this place is great .
. expensive beers cold ... do see fruit flies .
with two ahead of us great as always .
. wait staff on point .
i would n't recommend in n out to anyone .
i buy all my indoor plants from <UNK> .
the owners are robert and michelle hung .
this new yorker wo n't be going back .
the beef <UNK> is the best in town .
we never had a bad meal here .
very good food and average price for las vegas .
the malbec on the wine list was outstanding .
terrific spot - recommend reservations if you can .
what a great trip and views .
entertaining trip with a great pilot .
they went above and beyond in their assistance .
i was somewhat satisfied with the service .
the rock is solid .
use the safe and locks next time .
the caviar bar was cool though .
location in clean and the staff is friendly .
not worth the money .
this was my stop at the <UNK> .
this is the top of my list .
loved the food at this place .
unfortunately , good yelp reviews led me to <UNK> .
i did n't get what they were going for .
that ' s all fine .
so now , down to the food .
dinner : 00 minutes .
and of course , a coke .
the bbq beans are always a perfect side dish .
all of their tostadas are made differently .
the firecracker roll was good .
the service was awesome .
the <UNK> is incredible .
the meat servers are also on a constant roll .
also , the towering sashimi poki is <UNK> .
service is still very good too !
the pizza slices are huge , and decent .
but nothing ` ` amazing ' ' .
just decent pizza in an enormous slice .
there ' s no places to sit .
the best part is the rockabilly music playing .
been a little while since the last sushi exploration .
no further explanation necessary .
pros : tasty and quick .
this fine establishment gets 00/00 .
and at 00 bucks a pop ?
i left that barber shop looking brand new .
these same experiences have happened to me many times .
the mac and cheese was baked and on point .
this place deserves another visit .
massive disappointment - waste of money .
anyone giving mystere a positive review has no standards .
this place is flat out amazing .
best <UNK> food in town .
overall though , a great place with great prices .
this place is amazing .
i had the 00 inc with pep and sausage .
the environment of this place is also really cool .
. damn good way to spend twenty bucks .
this place was pretty good .
this place is very meh for me .
very good laugh at that one .
overall , a 0 star place .
why not combine them ?
they are not quite 0 star .
nothing out of the ordinary for a chinese place .
this place is ok at best .
. no big deal .
thanks mike and the guys .
<UNK> member for over 00 years .
we have no available rooms .
this place is great .
service it top notch .
had a 0-0 hr wait .
drive the extra mile for better peace of mind .
0 for the years <UNK> year everything was good .
second year i noticed prices going up in rent .
to anyone i know .
thanks <UNK> ' s , good job .
drinks were also not very good .
no silverware until after the food got there .
it ' s old school .
<UNK> is awesome and does a great job .
gabe is a <UNK> .
the service was adequate .
for these type of prices i expect much more .
the coffee was really good , nice roast .
go anywhere else in the valley for service .
the room was very clean .
it has gotten worse with each visit .
what can i say about the beer ?
this place is great .
a very nice cozy place .
stayed in the hotel for a golf tournament .
the variety of poke was excellent .
prices are very good .
good greek restaurant , nice ambiance , outstanding gyros .
ok setting off the east side mall strip .
i guess they did n't watch james bond .
the sea food meat alternative is less than great .
the sea food meat alternative is less than great .
trendy some may call it pretentious bar / restaurant .
on the noisy side , no ac .
my problem for not checking in advance .
do n't make it your problem .
the vibe is that of a classy dive bar .
they serve only 0 brand frozen yogurt here .
an historic home downtown turned into a bar ?
the selection of bottled beers is pretty great .
i like the charm of this place a lot .
these tacos are awesome .
the breakfast bagel is solid too .
` ` pleasant ' ' - <UNK> surprised .
bbq bacon burger was excellent .
portions were small as well .
old and run down .
this place is out of control good .
they even have chorizo tacos that were the bomb .
the wait time was brief .
the waiter was extremely professional and instantly introduced himself .
great price and great work .
had the elk chop , not that great .
' ' first , the service was very good .
maybe something else would hit a home run .
i was served quickly and politely every time .
great ambiance and good beer selection too .
the crowd is pretty varied in age .
i know absolutely nothing about cars .
the atmosphere is always incredible .
this place came as a huge surprise .
it was also very expensive .
a welcome choice in that general location of vegas .
+ good location , on the monorail line .
nice to experience this .
so a few things to recap here .
was it worth it cadillac of las vegas ?
already the cosmopolitan has built the <UNK> <UNK> .
many diverse offerings but often a little pricey .
lost a customer and a sale .
where to start once you are seated ?
give ' em a try !
the grass is almost always green and well maintained .
guess that is why i keep returning !
nice , vibrant environment .
taste portions or 0 oz .
how can you beat that ?
this is high-quality , <UNK> fast food .
smashfries are of the retro , shoestring style .
now this is what dining is all about .
they also serve alot of other authentic polish dishes .
so , here was my experience as an out-of-towner .
that is called shady and wrong .
service is poor , the <UNK> .
spend the money on fogo de chao .
the next day i went to return the bike .
` ` well those walmart bikes are poor quality .
we do n't buy bikes from walmart or amazon .
' ' still paid the $ 00 .
one star for the <UNK> .
the food is great .
order with pretzel bun .
they are making sure the guest are treated right .
some places i will never step foot in again .
daily slot play for my 0 night stay .
i just did everything online .
more updates to follow .
just checking out of the plaza .
overall we had another great stay .
the rewards from the club are endless .
thanks everyone for treating me like a high roller .
keep up the good work .
until next time fellow yelpers , scott
horrible ghetto pawn shop .
great local sushi spot .
meat loaf kills what culinary dropout offers .
the inferno menu is no joke .
always a great meal .
probably the best thai in las vegas .
the selection of kicks is nothing less then excellent .
the food is truly amazing here .
the mint is an awesome atmosphere for all .
but the breakfast sandwich is worth the wait .
i have been going here for years .
their lunchtime buffet is awesome and very well priced .
nice atmosphere , friendly efficient staff .
i can not recommend team arizona highly enough .
a wonderful setting for a meal .
good service , does get packed at <UNK> .
the us arm of english food giant tesco .
imo the best chinese in phoenix !
pleasing atmosphere and friendly staff , reasonable prices .
this is one of my favorite burger joints .
also has online reservation service which is most convenient .
very convenient parking and a garden area out back .
reminded me of similar places in london .
imo fuddruckers is the place to get a burger .
service is the absolute problem .
good service is hard to find these days .
great selection of comics , trades , and figurines .
i was at least offered a team lead .
' ' corporate will hear about this .
great vibes , good music , and amazing smoke .
they also allow reg tobacco use which i dig .
the other excellent indian restaurant in <UNK> .
superb food , great staff .
my local indian restaurant / takeaway of choice .
great for big groups or a quick lunch .
the <UNK> menu is great value .
# 0.00 with coffee for two .
there are a few better places in the area .
the food was great .
i do n't think it knows what it .
this review spans a few years .
not much has changed .
dead i tell you .
go back to phoenix and rip everybody off there !
does anybody miss blockbuster video ?
they ca n't fix a poorly <UNK> <UNK> !
0 up ? ? - rrb - .
0 up ? ? - rrb - .
great staff , great prices .
great staff , very friendly .
one of my go to places .
may go again this trip .
tim and his crew were awesome .
he even brought an extra guy .
the quality ranges from sub-par to so-so .
good place for lunch friendly staff and very clean .
the place has changed and not for the better .
customer advice for what it ' s worth .
great for running , biking , dog walking .
timely , helpful , gets stuff done right .
downsides : - price .
the complex is priced as a premium property .
the experience and execution was excellent .
this place delivers on so many levels .
. as it is so not rural usa !
however i consumed everything presented to me .
the service was attentive .
great place for a nice enjoyable dinner .
probably would vote best bbq in city .
must try ribs and brisket .
blue cheese burger was just par .
trust me on this one .
this place really rocks .
these guys only work on audi / vw .
their <UNK> and professionalism are most appreciated by me .
these were fun , but not very challenging .
they did great work at a great price .
service was very good .
my first impression was n't good .
today , <UNK> failed on the services part .
that ' s a good way to do it .
the waiter changed it with no problem .
so i give my waiter a pass on that .
we go there often .
$ 0.00 a good price .
what a find and what nice people .
great price but no car .
large with beans & rice .
once of the better within the area .
everything so far has been good .
i will not be going to cu again .
great clubs reside here .
cosmopolitan is the one of the nicest cool hotel .
it ' s a must visit .
this place is crap .
pretty good indian food in phoenix .
frankly , inside seemed loud .
modern , sleek , overpriced , and uncomfortable .
<UNK> 0000 and flying horse my top picks .
the mongolian beef packs a punch .
this is a great place for breakfast .
how can a fast food place not have drinks ?
what happened to this place ?
it use to be value for your dollar .
both were great ! ! the service was excellent .
they try to nickel and dime you .
this place is huge .
parking is more than ample .
best restaurant in maricopa county bar none .
but not very <UNK> either .
the problem is , though , with <UNK> .
this one is above average by international standard s .
but overall worth repeat visits best pizza in scottsdale .
and friendly italian owner to boot .
food was very average , but not bad .
and tony is a great host .
it was n't very crowded or loud .
great alternative to benihana .
the quality here is far better than panda express .
whatever was working before is missing now .
i wonder what brought about the changes .
chairs need an upgrade .
their pizza is awesome .
im going to give them 0 stars again .
the food is spot on .
i changed my mind about this place .
it was 00 dollars .
for 0 bux , what a joke .
place was really good .
one guy starts u off w your sauce .
it was the slowest process in the world .
overall , the pizza is just really poor quality .
total bill was 00 bux .
the seating here is <UNK> .
overall , biggest rip off in the world .
worst seating arrangement in the world .
place is just foul this place has great pizza .
u got ta try it .
first time visiting one in scottsdale .
you can do better .
good <UNK> , but : 0 .
great little comic book store .
staff is friendly and willing to help .
it ' s actually pretty good .
something was lost in their quest to rapidly franchise .
the outdoor seating is rickety and unsafe .
i miss what america ' s used to be .
but this restaurant was a bad experience .
i went the 0st time with some co workers .
i just went again last night with my partner .
i am a wing fanatic .
my partner got the enchiladas .
they had unlimited horchata which was awesome .
a very , very nice man .
a quote at a very reasonable amount .
moving day , showed up an hour late .
finally , an hour after appointment they showed .
i learned my lesson .
just a drab with their people .
most people would never come back .
well , i had a flat this week .
so i looked for a new place .
we also split their version of a pub salad .
i enjoy great starters like that .
i split the carne asada burrito with my partner .
my system just did not agree .
overall , the evening was not bad .
i like to refer to that as double dipping .
this place is a great addition to the neighborhood .
bought a nice bmw from <UNK> .
he really cares about total satisfaction .
00 minutes total before we left the lot .
service is generally faster but today was bad .
great start so far .
you get the idea .
just parking issues but great overall .
they do not have total reward discount .
this is what they intend to do .
this is a great shop .
i came here at 0am and ordered wings .
two words - great service .
even so , i heavily encourage a <UNK> .
did n't find any around gate d .
but the bartender did n't bring beers .
i ' ll keep this as short as possible .
` ` make it quick .
i ca n't even explain how good it was .
this was once again amazing .
first off , the good is way too expensive .
the seared beef tongue is a must buy .
this establishment leaves a lot to be desired .
great place to escape the 000 heat .
try the world tour of <UNK> .
do n't waste your time .
overpriced , under seasoned , <UNK> .
i should have known better for a tourist trap .
the had a to order taco bar .
the bbq section brought a tear to my eye .
brisket that you would sell your soul for .
then go to david wong ' s !
the food was fantastic .
the gouda cheese was very strong in the grits .
everything is just awesome ! ! nothing negative .
details on here will not help you at all .
it has to be a personal experience .
the g . t . c tasted weird .
gratuity should only be charged with 0 or more .
place is not crowded like other spots in vegas .
these <UNK> service professionals that is who .
then who has the audacity to argue about it ?
you guessed it , these guys .
not worth 00.00 a person .
great quick service and good price .
our server was named <UNK> .
this trip knocked them down to 0 stars .
maybe i ' ll try the pho next time .
gelato in the evening is excellent too .
hands down best donuts in town .
bbq and pittsburgh are usually <UNK> words .
the brisket here changes that .
i am from texas and love beef bbq .
ordered : the <UNK> fried rice ; nothing special .
taking this place off my restaurant rotation .
they were both good , although nothing special .
over-all churn is ok , nothing <UNK> more .
all this for 0 bucks .
until the food came .
it is amazing for the price .
well done brandon , nice place , great food .
- rrb - rare , 0 star banner .
friday <UNK> about 0 ` ` 00 .
probably over 00 minutes minimum .
not the best service .
staff is less experienced i think .
we still do business there .
tabbouleh was the best i can recall ... ever .
my wife had <UNK> and enjoyed it a lot .
parking is sometimes an issue .
sometimes local places can be surprisingly good .
service was slow but friendly .
this was a good dining experience .
i had a sausage and onion flatbread : good .
the place is really really noisy at night .
that was the downside .
apparently the beer production is contracted out .
last time there were only two .
i doubt i will find many here .
blanco is n't as loud .
there was also a good looking <UNK> .
several sandwiches are there too .
there is a great , but expensive seafood selection .
service was great , as usual .
it does take plastic .
<UNK> drinks are self serve .
beer and wine are available .
i hope it survives .
the pale ale tasted good and was hoppy enough .
our waiter knows his beer .
i will keep returning for the beer .
service was n't very good .
last review was n't very positive .
things are much better from my perspective .
pizza was always good but this was better .
the beer was great .
service was much better than my previous visit .
please disregard my december review .
i stopped in to see what is new .
definitely worth a stop .
it was ok here .
the park is well maintained considering its heavy use .
there are many <UNK> in the world .
this is one of the better ones .
however there are genuine high end items here .
it is worth stopping .
we had a great meal with excellent service .
friends had chilean sea bass which they liked .
as i said , expensive but all very good .
first time i had been here for years .
or maybe it is the other way around .
the whiskey selection is outstanding .
when in scottsdale i get my hair cut here .
staff changes but service remains the same .
the price is right .
still a great meal for the price .
first visit with friends who had been here before .
most others in the restaurant were <UNK> doing business .
it might be the best italian restaurant in phoenix .
my wife and a friend had the ravioli special .
this is a great restaurant .
we were given a four hour window .
there is a model train exhibition too .
my wife loved the <UNK> .
the second glass came much faster .
we will try it again in a few months .
happy hour today was ok .
service was n't great .
we were one of two tables .
food is decent : pizza , sandwiches , salads .
service is almost always good .

most first run movies get here .
parking usually easy to find .
an assistant dropped chips and salsa immediately .
it arrived several minutes late .
my wife loves pollo fundido .
i get a burrito .
service is always good .
the place is popular and filled quickly .
i had a beef flauta for something different .
food seemed about the same .
this is still a good place for lunch .
they are all good .

this is a place everyone should see .
parking was an issue .
they did n't finish but saved everything .
service was good enough but staffing confused me .

i enjoyed the place .
i had burger and fries : ok .
the location does n't concern me .
the food was good but not five star .
it was a great day to dine outside .
we had an excellent lunch .
the white pizza needed salt but was tasty .
the dulce de leche crepes were great .
some items seem high priced but others do n't .
i had the appetizer mussels as a main course .
we are n't sure what could have been done .
not sure why those three were less noisy .
the beer selection was adequate .
from there it is full service .
seemed a good idea to check it out .
there were some interesting beers .
we may try this again but not soon .

i have consumed <UNK> beer here if that helps .
things are much better .
the prosciutto was good .
no alcoholic beverages are served .
you pay for what you get .
i have had ribeye and kansas city bone-in cuts .
which brings me to price : it is expensive .
parking was satisfactory by old town standards .
it is in an interesting neighborhood .
price was fair by local standards .
each time was a little worse .
wait staff loses touch with customers .
getting his attention for the second round was harder .
better than the alternative .
this is a good place to visit .
the babaganoush and hummus were excellent .
the israeli salad was what one would expect .
the price was right .
this is a noisy place .
fortunately we left as the live music started .
other places tried and closed .

it is an excellent place for lunch .
my wife believes the pollo fundido is the best .
this is a good restaurant in most ways .

do you people not enjoy good pizza ?
the place is clean and well lit .
third , not the best target selection .
difficult to see the holes on an indoor range .
they also provide law enforcement discounts .
wayyyy too long to be seated .
i will never rent from these guys again !
came here for the ccw course and left satisfied .
emailed business , called business .
visited cabo sunday at 0:00 pm .
place was packed to the gills .
the blue fin from spain was unbelievable .
keep up the great food and service chef andy .
stayed here on business earlier this year .
ca n't go wrong .
our a / c died over the weekend .
just prompt , courteous service .
really enjoyed this breakfast joint .
the server was very courteous as well .
this is a perfect low key italian joint .
started with a $ 00 draft beer .
pretty good , but pricey at 00 bucks .
again , just at or below average in quality .
i had remembered it being awesome .
it was average at best .
the chicken caesar salad was below average .
the scenery is spectacular .
you overlook the bellagio water show and lake .
the service is always on point .
ca n't use card under 00 $ purchase .
great spot for breakfast .
they also offer very flavorful sandwiches and pasta dishes .
service was not astounding but not obnoxious either .
amazing place , and awesome atmosphere .
he tells us about this joint .
as good as it gets .
good but not as great as others are saying .
the bad the naan simply was n't very good .
what a wonderful little pizza shop .
great response time and quality work .
as promised , jeremy delivered !
this place can suck it .
sitting in an empty waiting room .
it was like this my two previous visits .
<UNK> is the man .
his estimates are low and honest .
<UNK> are used to show ownership , not <UNK> .
for an embassy suites this is lackluster .
throw it in , geez .
five guys this is not .
average sandwich ... tuna was bland .
a good mall burrito .
worth a stop but not a return .
this place is a good but not great edition .
anyway this place is worth a visit for sure .
that right there is a major issue .
definitely not up to <UNK> richard ' s standards .
weed smoke was in the air all night .
the bar is okay nothing special .
this is a <UNK> weekend review .
no huge issue though .
i recommend the big chill for your partying needs .
re-fried beans were a tasty and flavorful add on .
the mgm is a great choice when visiting vegas .
this place is awesome for banh mi sandwiches .
but be aware , they can sometimes sell out .
the food is great .
i ' ve been here 0 to 0 times .
one of the top spots in town .
wonton soup is very tasty .
wow one was a <UNK> .
the kind like <UNK> to the chalkboard .
nice change of pace and scenery from vegas .
bad food , bad service , high prices .
how can it get worse ?
this place makes hometown buffet feel special .
effects of rising food costs ?
food was above average .
prime rib was very good , asian food decent .
surprisingly had a mexican station .
still recommended however , if you can afford it .
anyway ... great spot here off the strip .
even better than grimaldi ' s .
i went to five guys and left .
casino area is unremarkable .
this show was uninspired , unremarkable and boring .
i am an out-of-state las vegas property owner .
so what do i have in las vegas ?
plus malts , shakes , etc . .
. again , good stuff .
nice atmosphere , friendly people , good service .
this place is awesome .
and the people there rock ... always friendly .
very solid italian establishment in the summerlin area .
i recommend the capicola pizza with the pale ale .
a + overall , you will not be disappointed .
the best african american upscale barber shop in charlotte !
the folks at sam ash are first class !
the staff is both knowledgeable and helpful .
sam ash is my store .
i just had the worst experience at this place .
skip the bad service and cold food at smashburger .
excellent food at <UNK> low prices .
this is a hidden gem inside the riviera hotel .
he wrote on my receipt and i left .
but too many words just screws up great beer .
just get these people on the damn plane .
thank god i went to see these guys !
my experience was pretty good .
it was properly cleaned and fuel .
deposit reversed 0 days after my after hours return .
solid , that pretty much sums up this place .
i assume most <UNK> are doubly impressed by this .
my reaction however , was that - 0 .
the service was excellent .
well played shake shack , well played .
why review a gas station ?
i think this place is pretty bad .
everything came out good and the service was excellent .
the steak was good but not amazing .
cooked perfectly with a nice <UNK> .
i recently purchased a used 0000 m0 here .
overall it was a friendly and painless transaction .
it was decent at best .
the seating on the balcony also sucked though .
new facilities with great shooting lanes .
the fish sandwich tasted fresh and was cooked well .
this is a basic diner .
the pub burger was ok .
i stayed at <UNK> casino for a recent conference .
all of the starters were killer .
no complaints with service .
<UNK> curry - good for 0 persons .
dinner : had dosa and <UNK> <UNK> .
lunch buffet : was also good .
would never see it again even at half price .
that says a lot coming from me .
they played mission impossible twice .
when i arrived my order was not ready yet .
you would expect the manager to say no problem .
not sure i will ever return .
well <UNK> to keep <UNK> at bay .
prepare for a show every 00 minutes .
maybe my approach was off .
absolute rip off if you ask me .
i found this place from reviews on yelp .
no draft beer available .
get the chicken pho to go .
great staff and neighborhood atmosphere .
had the southwestern omelet ... with greasy chorizo .
00/00 would recommend to anyone .
the owner , mark , is outstanding .
the owner , mark , is outstanding .
great place to get a regular car wash .
matt at the chandler location is the man !

fantastic pho and service .
flat out the best pizza in madison .
it will be a good afternoon .
a large variety of donuts .
this is my first review .
halibut , filets , chicken , ribeye .
i did n't have one bad thing to say .
the are at the top of their game .
the nicest , most helpful people work here .
there ' s nothing here for me .
it is very funny .
their weapon selection is outstanding .
0 stars this place is a treat .
0 bucks for a buffet .
edit : went back 0 days later .
ended up waiting about fifteen minutes for our <UNK> .
walked over to the gelato section for desert .
i am amazed that places like this still exist .
did you guys get a new chef ?
hands down worth 0x what they charge .
the selection is the same .
and this location happens to have superb staff .
so why the 0 star , you might ask ?
00 minutes later , still no check .
everybody here is super friendly .
and <UNK> does not fail here .
the beer selection is amazing .
that can not be a bad thing .
most certainly not recommended .
how do you beat that ?
ca n't beat that with a stick .
i do n't know what they did to it .
i ' ve been to worse places .
i was no longer a skeptic .
then the main meal ... wow .
the staff were all extremely friendly and good <UNK> .
simply put : wow .
it ' s not spectacular .
the food is made from fresh , local ingredients .
i move further away and i keep coming back .
that ' s all there is to it .
a very nice atmosphere .
unfortunately this is where the low rating comes from .
- rrb - values to be found !
they ' ve got great products .
but for that price , i expect quality .
that describes fairly accurately my experience here .
fast and friendly very aptly describes them .
oh yeah then there ' s the bar .
then there ' s the craft beer .
even after i told three people .
now granted , the menu is rather <UNK> .
. may have to cheat on you a bit .
oh yes , scotch ... mmmmm .
<UNK> looks good and but the food was <UNK> .
the place is overpriced and over rated .
there was a noticeable <UNK> with the staff .
the food was incredible .
comme ã <UNK> a burger - absolutely delicious flavor .
the infinity <UNK> are fun .
i ' m defiantly going there again .
this place has it all covered .
<UNK> do not reheat well .
now that ' s just funny .
now i ' m a pro .
i will recommend these guys to everyone .
the best pizza west of ny .
the wings were nice and crispy .
i always order the miso ramen with extra chasu .
the bed was also quite comfortable as well .
. but how can you screw up naan ?
the pizza on wednesday nights is amazing .
the reason for three stars is the service .
trying to get food to go is almost impossible .
nothing too graphic and such .
the newest lg to hit the market .
i also purchased the extended warranty plan as well .
. hmmm ... smartest guy they had i guess .
or can it be the technician ?
being a working man .
highly recommend this place .
. well worth it to have great service .
i highly recommend using troy .
. when the best pictures can be taken .
you truly hate to see the ride end .
i highly highly recommend these guys .
. go see these guys .
. these guys understand and can be trusted .
after getting my car back .
. the suspension components were never even touched .
the oil did stop leaking .
. i figured lesson learned .
recently the car started leaking again .
same place it was leaking the first time !
they ripped me off for close to $ 0000 .
fearing for my wallet .
but does n't charge extra .
i then apologized for my short attitude with him .
. sure it has issues .
i highly recommend using them .
. what i feel was fair prices .
the <UNK> was great .
good atmosphere for $ rating .
great bourbon list with amazing prices as well .
highly recommend this place .
guaranteed great shows in denver .
not so much in tempe .
location is nice though .
would highly recommend to anyone .
i ' ll be back .
lots to eat to the point of <UNK> overload .
sammy <UNK> would be pissed .
a fun place for out-of-towners .
the result was awesome .
the snapper was very chewy .
i was staying at the westin across the street .
tons of beer selection .
cheaper and far far better !
ordered meatball sub n <UNK> salad .
was the downtown shithole .
dont get me started w the <UNK> bbq sauce .
keep up the good work !
being in a wheelchair was easy to maneuver around .
eaten here <UNK> only pizza .
pizza places should never run out of certain things .
they were priced very reasonable compared to other companies .
i ' ve been to better .
` ` here , chop that ' ' .
` ` cup of this .
here measure it with this ' ' .
great experience all around .
the food and service were great .
pacific in chandler , is garbage in comparison .
except there should be a 0 star rating .
i highly recommend this place .
this man proved nothing was beyond his abilities .
thanks again jon ... great job ! ! !
best place to lose weight from diarrhea .
make sure you have a 00 min before boarding .
from the host , excellent welcome .
place need to train the servers .
what a great find .
the mozzarella sub is absolutely amazing .
big fan of this place .
especially considering the reduced portions .
it seems like they have lost a step .
it may be well worth it !
definitely a good place for a pre boarding snack .
ca n't go wrong .
tom is a good friend with the family .
so why three stars ?
the smell of the place is ... interesting .
great location but that ' s about it .
this is a place you have to check out .
a great place to catch some grub .
this is your typical airport bar .
nothing fancy but nothing really bad about this place .
we were quickly greeted and seated upon arrival .
they have some pretty good beers on tap .
i landed on the four peaks raj .
inside , this place appears to be rather small .
they have great beers on tap and excellent food .
since my last review they have doubled in size .
you wo n't be disappointed .
they offer mediocre seafood with over the top waitstaff .
the <UNK> beer selection is less than desired .
this hotel is a-ok .
i consider this one of the better holiday inns .
the tv is a larger lcd type .
i had the bbq bacon burger .
their beer selection is n't half bad .
the service was slow as shit .
it was a solid representation of a great burger .
i had a king suite in the camelback building .
the tvs were all the old tube style .
they also have authentic mexican beers on tap .
this place is awesome .
very weak wifi , no business center .
the entire experience was excellent .
the waiter engaged in friendly conversation .
paris was great carnitas are not carnitas .
the gym and spa is a 0star
our other favorite is the sunset roll .
they can not be reviewed on one thing alone .
the outdoor patio is awesome !
on top of that it comes to you quickly !
the staff is all about efficiency .
this place is simple and to the point .
choosing what to order is certainly an enjoyable experience .
i recommend the cajun meatloaf .
the space has two levels and is very authentic .
you can thank me later .
this place claims to serve saint louis barbecue spareribs .
really cool place with good food .
one of the largest i have ever been to .
the staff as usual was absolutly terrific .
very friendly and great to deal with .
the food was the usual ok .
we had the <UNK> three plate sampler .
we heard about this place through a friend .
the staff was tremendous .
we had the ribs and chicken combo .
chicken seems to be a <UNK> for all establishments .
good memorabilia displayed as well .
he would get 0 stars .
we had the roots bbq brisket .
these folks have never had good brisket .
this was not even brisket .
however , pizzeria bianco is not one of them .
overall bang for buck was well worth it .
this place is a sports bar and nothing more .
not the healthiest of <UNK> but very good !
a nice gastro pub .
we ordered the sausage penne and the bistro burger .
it ' s barely average here .
the buffalo one was interesting .
the classic , peppercorn and one other .
it is dipped in a banana cream batter .
the service here is great .
it was served with a bleu cheese slaw .
the slaw was just ok .
i ordered the rack of <UNK> .
the service : the service overall was average .
i would give it a 0 .
the service : lacking .
that would not keep me from coming back .
the chicken enchiladas were dry and kind of flavorless .
the fish tacos were terrible .
he was attentive , but wayyyyy overboard .
service has always been bad at this location .
i do n't even know where to start .
the food here was terrible .
my girlfriend called it poor man ' s bread .
service was great here .
the wait time was not that bad .
this place was pretty good .
the hash browns were meh .
service was good here .
on a positive note , the staff was fantastic .
friendly and works hard and quick .
the wait staff was extremely genuine and friendly .
best wings in pittsburgh , great specials .
pretty good hawaiian bbq place .
better than ono hawaiian in goodyear .
first off , awesome beer .
no sense of community .
not the case here .
this is my go-to chinese take-out .
orange tofu and kung pao chicken are my favorites .
eric , the owner , is awesome .
ask him to go for a run some time .
. clearly <UNK> to a fast food chains creation .
orders are correct about 00 % of the time .
this seems like a signature part of their plating .
tonight i had the seafood <UNK> .
for desert i had profiteroles .
the make <UNK> slow cooked bbq .
i could not recommend this place highly enough .
the salad was not bad .
balsamic <UNK> was a reduction , i think .
the bbq pizza is amazing .
the deep dish crust is amazing .
i explained , i would be there shortly .
yelpers , stay away from this business .
i wish you guys were in nyc .
and extremely friendly staff .
this is my go-to italian spot .
they replaced the entire thing under warranty .
the wait was ridiculous .
however , go for the belgium imports ! ! !
you will not be dissappointed .
all the instructors genuinely care about your progression .
overall , it was great value for money .
the meal was still great .
the service was top notch , as always .
way to go above and beyond , mark .
- rrb - and the pricing was fair .
a great addition to the <UNK> / airpark area !
second , good coffee .
last , last but not least , the food .
well , 0 restaurants have yet to open .
call me cheap , but 00 cents ?
all in all , a great dining experience .
that being said , the food was excellent .
<UNK> sushi is everything you know barcelona to be .
the food was , without exception , amazing .
the presentation is great , as well .
to start , the service was great .
the line out front <UNK> to its popularity .
they sized him for <UNK> on thursday .
the service here is quick .
owning a bmw is nice ... for a while .
north scottsdale bmw : $ 000 .
same authentic bmw parts .
registration pick up was extremely easy and smooth .
the race ran smoothly , as always .
this is where all the action is .
the upstairs open patio is another story .
what a fantastic local restaurant .
a great experience , all around .
what a great improvement to this space !
the decor is pure sam fox .
yes , it was as good as it sounds .
all in all , a great dining experience .
i am a fan of sam fox restaurants .
the food was good , but not great .
decent food ... good service ... overpowering music .
this was head and shoulders above .
act like a local .
but , do n't act like a jerk .
on my left were two appliance <UNK> .
things started out well , but went downhill fast .
let ' s cut to the chase .
but , throw it in ?
before we lose focus , the sandwiches are great .
first off , home made pop tarts .
you heard me correctly .
food is what made it a little lower .
all the beer was great .
the install job was fantastic .
not many upscale places serve it for lunch .
anyone have a guess where this is heading ?
i request a manager to discuss .
easy to navigate and find what you need .
the donuts tasted like they were old .
the dunkin donuts there were moist and tasty .
that kind of service is unmatched .
fajitas were burned and steak was well done .
you cant go wrong with any of their choices .
what is a pasty you ask ?
the ambiance is excellent too .
not impressed with staff or place .
great price for a great place .
great sushi price for all-you-can-eat sushi at $ 00 .
this place hits the mark !
sushi here was a disgrace today .
the crew needs to step it up a bit .
there was n't really a ` ` rush .
delivery time is good .
layout could use some updating .
good subs , better than subway .
this place is great .
00 damn minutes waiting for lumber to be cut .
00 minutes later no lunch .
my problem is the <UNK> service itself .
i communicated with several guys over a few weeks .
<UNK> was amazing as the independent contractor mechanic .
0 + hour round .
no one took responsibility .
course was burning out in may .
here ' s what happened next .
prices were excellent , particularly when considering the value .
certainly more interesting than your general consignment shop .
coin prices are high .
the people there are nice .
all sales are final .
<UNK> at artful tailoring was fantastic .
finding a great tailor is a lost art .
had the 0 for $ 00 meals to go .
the food was hot and tasted good .
my place was a mess .
he arrived at the appointed time .
yea this is definitely a 0.0 .
one of my top five <UNK> in vegas .
back to la ok .
the atmosphere is friendly and service impeccable .
then there ' s the issue of <UNK> .
this is all just the beginning actually .
parking is horrific and appliances are old .
i was completely blown away .
all i can say is wow !
if i could give six stars i would .
the balsamic reduction on top was delicious .
i search deeper and no miller either .
had the sea bass as entree .
service was spot on .
excellent food , drinks , service and atmosphere .
the ribs and bbq chicken were delicious .
been visiting picazzo ' s for over 0 years .
the pasta and pizza are all very good .
love it ! ! wow ... what happened ?
even the chicken fried rice is a good meal .
go early to avoid a long wait .
additionally there are ` ` dairy-free ' ' options .
the chicken chimichanga was large and delicious .
great place for a car / truck wash !
the food is simply amazing .
aside from that , they get my highest marks .
everything was surface cleaned , at best .
and of course the center gaming area was closed .
there appeared to be only one roulette table open .
my partner had chicken mole .
chef made the rounds at lunch checking on everyone .
have been here twice in downtown charlotte .
service was half decent , very courteous and prompt .
it is definitely an interesting place .
it is half decent , but nothing amazing .
good service i ' ll be using again .
they are behind the palms casino .
this time was no exception .
i ordered the t-bone well done .
you get charged 0 $ more for extra meat .
so pictures are the key .
but things have changed from a year ago .
that extra charge to jersey mikes ?
too bad if they are out of business .
hope the owner / operator is okay .
i stopped here three times on my recent trip .
but still five stars .
inexcusable at these prices .
i got my food within 00 minutes of arriving .
i will be coming back .
all five members of our party felt the same .
the fettuccini was overlooked and chewy .
the second of our issues ?
the final issue and most concerning ?
that ' s almost 00 hours .
because it was a university of toronto ring .
these were the worst .
not horribly bad , not awesomely good .
great venue for almost any type of show .
reason for 0 stars ?
my back was sore after 00 minutes .
bleachers at sun devil stadium were more comfortable .
i guess they <UNK> worry about it .
jamba to me is the primo smoothie .
fresh and flavorful meats and options .
not a filibertos but not a real sit-down either .
great new place , close to home .
- probably not but that is all relative !
very friendly staff and is just getting started .
good stacked enchilada ' s & sopapilla ' s .
<UNK> great steaks and flavor for sure .
clean , convenient good restaurants around .
how can you not love costco ?
the mole was que bueno !
keep up the good work down there at <UNK> !
we will certainly make this a regular visit .
they have a nice patio and good staff overall .
as simon <UNK> would say ... sorry !
go do yourself a favor and try them out .
maybe i came in on a bad ... ?
i have driven past it many times .
do n't miss this place .
try not to get a table near the bar .
the place can use some remodeling though .
best pizza this side of new york hands down !
tons of stuff to buy and eat .
a top contender for my favorite spot in gilbert .
they had one left and <UNK> .
i could not believe what i walked into .
i have never seen it this bad .
in all seriousness , beware .
outstanding , each and every time .
the arizona smoked wings are killer .
keep up the good work !
their food and specials do n't hurt either .
first time trying out this place .
safe to say we abandoned ship and walked out .
we returned to postino and all is well .
better luck next time .
the iced toddy at cartel is extremely delicious .
extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff .
not room cleaning is available .
food could be better but it was pretty good .
the ribs were way better than i expected .
the rib is a beef rib .
poor directions and even worse common meeting areas .
always find a <UNK> ' s and enjoy .
not wow , but good .
nice ball field to catch a game .
in semi close ... good feel for the game .
easily the best optometrist i have visited .
ten minutes and still nothing .
just good ` ` <UNK> ' ' service .
i ' ve been in 0 times total .
one guy in particular stood out .
this place is great .
motivation and dedication pour out of this place .
lets get the facts straight with this place .
the 00 day aged ny steak is incredible .
a must for steak lovers .
i like pork chops .
i ' m not a horse .
all of the interesting japanese beers were not available .
it was actually pretty good .
nice atmosphere and excellent panna <UNK> .
the <UNK> was great too .
i was a little disappointed .
never been before but will definitely go back .
next come the <UNK> © s .

saturday special is beef short rib 00.00 a pound .
the in house bbq sauces made up for that .
like mike said affordable bbq .
it took a goof 00-00 minutes for my food .
open till about 0 most nights .
possibly swamp cooler type cooling .
good wine and beer selection as well .
great experience every time .
great experience with each staff member i interacted with .
very squishy and slimy .
i can vouch for the polish and fire dogs .
all hit the spot .
beijing style hot & sour <UNK> and mongolian beef .

the <UNK> and <UNK> are always fresh as well .
yes my mouth is watering just describing it .
the service from beginning to end was great .
the host was very energetic friendly and prompt .
first time ever shooting a gun .
no time limit with the package .
peoples comments on service are on point .
two people with drinks expect a ill 00-00 .
led screen menus with at least 00 different choices .
surprisingly a very small portion for ten bucks .
but lets focus on what they are known form .
they do serve beer as well .
salsa and guac are good .
dive bar near wal mart and home depot ... .
great location in downtown chandler .

the veal parmesan is a <UNK> .
great place , if you can get a seat .
considering i am an lvac member .
i really enjoyed this place .

as professionals i believed them .

a couple of notes about the people .
hands down the best vapor spot in town .
the reptile section still needs some work .
- rrb - the zoo itself is pretty cool .
the sharks and <UNK> were fantastic .
its a small store , but still pretty cool .
the ambiance needs some work .
it is a shame that this location is closing .
<UNK> : pretty bad and pretty expensive .
it is not cool or inventive or intriguing .
eleven bucks well spent .
carter the owner was friendly and professional .

service was quick and friendly enough .
the service here alone is worth the visit .
thanks for everything guys , james <UNK>
staff were helpful and the place was clean .
usual in-n-out fare , which is to say excellent .
essentially this is middle-eastern version of chipotle .
the cost is high but the value is higher .
i really ca n't get enough of this place .
oh , larger portions ?
i could care less .
sucks to be him .
price is right as well .
next , my veal chop came out raw .
the men ' s facility is amazing .
the final course was a play on peaches .
it reminds me of the pizza den in nj .
great place for a business dinner as well .
she knew all the muscle structure and pressure points .
outstanding in almost every way .
two quick and easy points : 0 .
they charge by the <UNK> .
the round more than doubled in cost .
nothing to complain about .
i knew i was in for a great meal .
nothing better or worse .
the az burger was awesome .
most bottles are a minimum of 0x retail .
the smoked bacon was a bit overpowering but good .
no ketchup , mustard or mayo .
amazing quality and very good service .
just bring some serious cash if you are hungry .

then came the huge hot rock .
you can probably make 0-0 bombs out of this .
i ' ll pass on a return visit .
the fish was remarkable .
the staff is very friendly , and extremely knowledgeable .
for the area , this should be 0 stars .
all very good , but not outstanding .
that alone is 0 stars .

glad to see the master , <UNK> , again .
ongoing construction huge inconvenience .
entry doors can be heard down the hallway .
all this for $ 000 a night .

so yeah , it ' s expensive .
bad company and bad owner .
owners word means nothing .
great customer service , very fast and reasonable .
one of the better mediterranean places in phoenix .
the cheeseburger with gyros is awesome .
diners drive ins and dives material !
the food was excellent .
there is a reason it rates so good !
this a hidden gem in phoenix .
the place has a modern feel to it .
i will be coming back .
had a belgium beer on tap .
the food and service used to be great .
even one of the utensils had stuff on it .
the service was really fast from design to print .
bravo , joe beef !
americanized , large plates of re-heated slop .
in a word : wow .
not the best start to a vegas vacation .
disappointing , first time tonight .
they know there stuff .
they have the best teriyaki chicken in town .
this is bad business .
otherwise this place is next to amazing .
half of the extremely limited menu was unavailable 0 .
service was n't any better than the food .
that would have to be my biggest complaint .
i did not feel this was appropriate .

i recommend the sub sandwiches .
seemed like they fell short of their goal .
bad news - 0 .
in-room coffee costs $ 0 a cup .
wth x 0 ! ! ! 0 .

fried rice was usual .
really good chimichanga and grande burro .
the environment is very very loud .
this place is amazing .
ok , that ' s not entirely true .
i simply love places like this .
the age demo varied from 00s through 00 + .
this place looks long past its glory days .
we tied a few of the appetizers .
the rellenos are home made .
i ordered the won ton soup as usual .

this place has some awesome sushi .
secondly , not a huge selection of sushi .
even the service was poor .
the food is grub .
took server 0 minutes to greet us .
truly felt as if we were not important .
we look forward to booking you again soon .
do long nacho daddy .
glad i looked these guys up on yelp .
much better deli in montreal .
they left most of it on the plate .
great tom kah yum and panang curry .
the negative is long check in line .
have you been to subway ?
imagine that system but with gyros and greek salads .
reasonably priced and good sports bar feel .
<UNK> irish music on the weekend .
the hot dogs / sausages are fantastic .
why then give it 0 stars ?
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
great management and workers who care about your needs .
great place to go and watching the game !
a good mechanic does not leave a harness <UNK> .
we are die hard sushi lovers .
we are picky and expect excellence .
possibly the worse company in american history .
lack of maintenance and return phone calls .
there business practices are shady at best .
<UNK> with small shades .
the veal was tough .
today they lost my business .
heard about the ` ` main event ' ' .
holy * % # @user !
perfectly cooked shrimp with gouda cheese grits .
i arrived a little early for my repair appointment .
surprisingly the bar area was practically empty .
. this was <UNK> bar and grill .
we frequented <UNK> often for meal specials .
it is now hub ' s .
00 yr old dude .
i ' m almost always the only guy there .
definitely worth a shot .
great tasting omelets and the best fresh-squeezed oj !
as honest as it gets !
huge thanks to gabriel !

great service , awesome atmosphere .
nicely located downtown with parking garages next door .
finally it was off to get the oil change .

they put their takeout in large aluminum pans .
perhaps they own stock in <UNK> ?
the ribeye was fairly good but not outstanding .
atmosphere inside is great also .

it only cost me $ 00 against $ 0000 .
they take no responsibility for their poor business practices .
it is a nice new facility that recently opened .
this is why it ' s not a 0 .
a warm to low spice ranch dip .

worth a 000 mile trip .
the customer is nobody at bb king ' s .
likely they treat paying customers better .
worst hotel experience in my life .
maybe it ' s a vegas thing ?
is this 0000 instead of 0000 ?

the pool closes early , too .
in fact , it was flat out awesome .
it was , as the ratings suggest , a-ok .

the most <UNK> place in vegas .
as lame as you might expect .
room service shuts down early afternoon .
some tasted old , some tasted fresher .

the waiter we had was enthusiastic and friendly .
this may just become my new local hangout .

it ' s obvious nobody test drove it !
- lrb - do n't use sears auto service .
there was nothing wrong with the struts !
outstanding pork belly and teriyaki beef dishes too .
service is above average !
i thought the breakfast was better than most places .
price was reasonably around $ 0 mark .
the food was lukewarm at best .
service was consistent as before .
with that considered parking was horrible here .
once the bathrooms are finished 0 stars plus
the burgr are fantastic .
great 0 - star dining experience .

expensive as shit though .
low weekend rates , check .
very very good stuff .
a true dining experience .
- lrb - hey , we ' re spontaneous .
well , the beer was cold ... burger sucked .
do we really need a high end sandwich shop ?
and pay 0-00 bucks for one ?
not just because i saw some <UNK> .
0 stars on venue only .
the most impressive part is the sound system .

the pot roast sandwich is just ok .
service overall is good .
a 0star rating on the hotel websites is accurate .
missing the service aspects of a 0 star .
overall , a good stay .

very attentive and courteous .
the service was excellent .
obviously , that is n't the case .
mo ' s bacon bar - <UNK> said .
- - - their pizza is usually pretty good .
the dr was very helpful answering questions .

consistently poor staffing at this location .
they share a location with <UNK> .
we got to the ticket counter around 00:00 pm .
so now i have re-opened the disputed inquiry .
i have serviced cars at sullivan <UNK> for decades .
nobody there has ever recommended <UNK> service .
` ` would you care for something else ?
cheap and very good tacos really hit the spot .
what really bothered me was their service .
mind u im sitting at the closest table .
there is a reason .
i thought five guys had it figured out .
the staff is fine .
sound good to you ?
a good number of <UNK> , unlike haze .
the place to be for younger peeps .
dude was a huge douchebag to others also .
these guys are pros .

the service is above and beyond generous .
i ' ll be back again .
everything about the beef or meatball sandwiches is perfect .
and they said keep the <UNK> burger .

overall a place i would highly recommend .
this is a great seafood buffet .
this is not a bad little chinese food place .
everyone that works here is very friendly .
i actually found out about this place from yelp .
i am glad i gave it a shot .

ca n't diagnose without a myriad of expensive tests .
even with the tests the diagnosis is wrong .
the prime rib was also pretty solid .
guess you should go somewhere else for that .
paul h these kudos are long overdue .
now you remember <UNK> .

great environment for college kids and other sports fans .
good for lunch with the family aswell .
i thought it was the front pads .
<UNK> brothers simply lied to me .

so i am satisfied with my experience here .
water for <UNK> drinkers and food truck parked outside .
well done <UNK> we will return .
. he pulled tom tom club !
money in paper voucher out .

so it appears to be popular .
give it a shot .
lame lame lame setup .
the beer selection was great and not overwhelming .
the place was filled with hipsters and beer lovers .
the staff knows beer .
worth a visit awesome structure .

the meat in the sandwich was okay .
the prices charged were reasonable .
i love the pollo fundido chicken burrito !

the jambalaya was fantastic .
a very nice cajun oasis in southern wisconsin .

huge selection of beers on tap .
service and ambiance are mostly top notch .
the owner completely stands behind his products .
its a <UNK> meat thats for sure .
it tops cut and sw steakhouse .

try and avoid the cover charge when you can .

how cool is that ?
now if only <UNK> could improve their service .
this place is second to none .
most of the food here is n't that great .
must be the warm and inviting atmosphere .
overall , a solid four star rating .
overall though , still a solid place .
good times for roberto ' s ... .
now on to the good stuff .
basic and to the point is what it is .
which includes the interior wipe down and tire shine .

the pork belly sliders were also amazing .

the service at the bar is solid to .
the rolls are solid and the sashimi as well .

that was the only con .
the local scottish sodas are really good too .
not your average <UNK> pub crowd .
good alternative to the <UNK> pub fare in edinburgh .

service was slow to nonexistent to forgetful .
manager was running around trying to fix everything .
an average dinner , nothing special .
opens at 000am 0 days .
a window between noon & 0pm .
one of the better , <UNK> buffets in town .
typical pizza hut pizza , greasy with average toppings .

oh and the delivery is lightning quick .
i rate it about a b - .
have never used the <UNK> washing machines .
just an average run-of-the-mill donut shop .
what a waste of time .
the bbq ribs about a b - .
complained to their corporate management to no avail .
i would rate this a 0â 0/0 stars .
place is dirty with a poor selection of food .
both times just a 0 star .
whoever the manager is should be fired immediately .
by far the best juice bar in pittsburgh .

a great big welcome to las vegas attitude .
the place was empty .

tried the cheese curd appetizer , which was excellent .
blown away by the staff here .

the hotel itself seems nice .
they explained high rise , low rise , etc !
i called several local jewelers from yelp .

the service is outstanding and the hospitality is <UNK> .
ten minutes later our food arrived .
the club was ok to say the least .
the ambience is still fantastic .
that is where all the good stuff ends .
he simply took away the bowl .
what more can u ask for ?
im getting hungry just talking about this place .

000 + degrees in the heat is unacceptable .
dinner for 0 ... $ 000.00 .
not worth the money .
crossfit full strength is an amazing gym .

it is elegant , grand , and amazing .
this place is a palace within a palace .
this place is a monstrosity .
it goes on for miles and miles .
the smallest of the buffets .
everything is meant to be eaten in small portions .
this place limits what they give out .
do n't let them fool you .
i am in , lets get in there steelers fans
do n't hate if you ca n't hang .
it ' s decent quality , for the price .

richard pro here with another review .
this is a pretty solid joint for korean food .
potato salad - lrb - korean version ?
we refilled most of them 0 times .
richard pro here with another review .
0 stars only because of the live entertainment .
interior is dark and loud because of the music .
best around down here in the east east valley .

i enjoyed the larger king cut prime rib .
the location is great across from city center .
our party of 0 enjoyed a great lunch .
i left vegas without gambling or loosing any money .
some areas of the hotel are still well worn .
i was here on business as usual .
two others enjoyed the <UNK> .
the days of the godfather series .
the weather in november was spectacular for outside dinning .
american shooters is operated by a military veteran .
this is the norm .
overall a nice dinning experience .
$ 00 charge was overall justified .
that is the first word that comes to mind .
room had a stale smoky smell to it .
good value for the money .
food was marginal at best .
will not stop here again .
pros : room was clean and well equipped .
nice grounds and good location .
but unlike many americans , i like the french .
very good all you can eat sushi .
will become a regular place to visit for sure .
we will visit again many times for sure .
friendly staff , great service .
t-bones is well below average .
i went to this place probably 00 years ago .
this placed is off the list .
the act is horrific from the opening number .
get rid of this .
great place with good employees .
note : does not brew on site .
everything is shipped in .
honest and well respected .
a diamond in the rough !
the 0nd best beer bar on the strip !
. but it is worth it .
despite mixed reviews i wanted to try this .
perfect way to end our vegas adventures .
this place does not disappoint .
front staff good , kitchen staff bad .
good grief , man .
its a solid 00 <UNK> steak .
oh buy 0 get 0 free <UNK> ?
all # 0 ' s for me , thanks .
buy 0 get 0 free lee ' s coffee ?
bonus : public service announcement .
wtf they ' re pairs .
how do you know ?
<UNK> people might hate this place .
ya , i said it .
nothing here is great or special .
everything was top notch .
no sign just a big hallway .
but i digress ... without the cirque part .
` ` illusions ' ' ? ? really ?
which is exactly what it is .
the entire hotel room smelled after taking a crap .
reasonable prices and great service .
the water park is subpar .
rip o'sheas ... you will be missed .
friendly and enjoying what they do .
vdara is the best hotel in las vegas !
i was blown away .
this place is awesome !
it is what it is .
good bar food and good talk .
keep this place a secret .
a great place for some food and brews .
best new restaurant in the phoenix area .
this place is very nice .
great for airport food .
great place to watch football outdoors .
set menu with a choice of 0 entries .
did not call ahead .
stay away at all costs .
the <UNK> brews were great as well .
the wings are great !
great spot for a sandwich .
this place was a hidden gem .
started with hummus which was also quite good .
been going here for years now .
<UNK> ' it great .
tell papa john to suck shit through fresh ingredients .
people want this place to burn .
went with <UNK> , a good friend of mine .
price was not too bad either .
avoid this place at all costs .
the gelato looked good though .
great service and friendly staff .
will definitely recommend and will come back for sure .
i keep coming back to this place .
awesome sauces tho food was nay to me .
wont be back there again .
the service department were pretty weak .
after arguing , they agreed to redo it limo .
. it ' s a chain .
let me give you an example .
even their atm here is reasonably priced .
very busy tight happening place .
this is foie grass heaven .
a long awaited shout out to these guys .
delivers on it ' s promise .
they are the best at being what they are .
inside it ' s all tile and <UNK> surfaces .
these youth are <UNK> fast food heroes .
i ca n't vouch for anything else .
these people will take care of you .
had no trouble surfing the web and watching videos .
that leaves the matter of my contacts .
the decor and ambience inside were a pleasant surprise .
an insane , ridiculous , <UNK> selection of whiskies .
it is , however , well worth the trip .
please dont go there its a waste of money .
try as much as you can .
but within my narrow experience , these guys excel .
this chip shop is the business .
the chips are hot and properly crisped .
the guy who now runs the <UNK> .
this is a good place with decent italian food .
far and away the best in edinburgh .
there were a few negative points .
i want to say a word about the <UNK> .
this establishment is one of edinburgh ' s gems .
nowhere else quite like <UNK> .
try the original reuben smoked meat sandwich .
excellent atmosphere and service .
quality , value , selection .
all of the indian cuisine staples .
you ' ll be pleasantly surprised .
this place is awesome .
the prices were also a touch high here .
but overall , a really solid place .
^ that statement alone sums up this place .
definitely among the better wings i ' ve had .
pastor was really nice on this one .
not really a fan .
it ' s basically all starch .
the guys there are very friendly as well .
i got it for the relatively low price .
hot sauce is a must for these .
shrimp creole : good and spicy but not incredible .
the other things just are n't that great .
it almost woke me up like ` ` woah .
- rrb - - - which are downright awesome .
<UNK> is a masterful teacher .
that said , bosa donuts is nice alternative .
i ordered shredded beef tacos .
however , the tacos did n't cut it .
this is a nice sam ' s club location .
why review a fast food chain ?
that ' s what this sonic location does well .
00 south is no exception .
that way you avoid the $ 0 cover charge .
one of the two stars above goes to him .
nothing complicated , but it was good .
that accounts for the second star .
is 0 feet considered crowding ?
those three blank stars ?
first i have to say i love fat sandwich .
they also have beer which is nice .
if you are in madison , stop here .
you wo n't regret it .
- rrb - by doing so .
the dining room was very nice and very clean .
this place looks promising .
great value for money .
their cappuccino is very good .
bally ' s room is big .
prices are good , service is great .
like their food presentations .
there are better deals out there .
their pasta selection was ` ` lifeless ' ' .
these guys are superior !
bathroom is same as on the plane .
seats were bigger than first class .
definitely worthy of a return visit !
unfortunately postrio has taken a turn for the worse .
. nothing that wow ` ed me .
located across from the golden nugget .
went here on a thursday jan 00 .
i would say max seating capacity is about 00 .
for us it was well worth the wait .
the giant air <UNK> was a noisy joke .
everything was well laid out and tastefully displayed .
the dining areas were kept very clean and clear .
very good , reasonably priced , consistent mediterranean joint .
service is good and consistent .
not likely a destination stop next time in vegas .
best part is the a + staff .
spacious floor plans , decent appliances and underground parking .
fish tacos were great .
delivery through wheel deliver .
we do our annual nfl fantasy draft here .
awesome wings , very meaty .
pad see ew noodles was savory and thick .
i was there solo and ate at the bar .
i grabbed the food and left .
best italian in madison .
caesar salad was excellent and the pizzas were superb .
host was energetic , fun and a great <UNK> .
i have never had a bad meal here .
. with attitude lost my business for ever .
or at least this location .
and not to argue with paying guest .
' ' they almost got the orders mixed up .
. to win free food .
. they had dj most of afternoon / evening .
. you will have fun and get rewarded .
. was on mill on 00-0 after 00pm .
. signage outside not easily <UNK> .
beer was excellent though .
thankfully , it ' s not a problem here .
loyal fan from here out .
00 minutes later we sat .
second , staff accordingly .
they know their product and concept to a tee !
` ` the buzz ' ' .
this is not hype , this is the <UNK> .
0 - <UNK> : full bar and great crafts .
a layout and design : 0/0 .
attention to detail and concept are great .
stick with the beer list .
so , is <UNK> a country bar ?
food was served fast and warm .
clean cut , well mannered .
it ' s a corporate thing i guess .
` ` ok ' ' they say .
stretched thin in texas , arizona and southern california .
a sad state of affairs .
it all started in 00 .
cinco de mayo was amazing .
looks like a great facelift has been done .
: - rrb - great look from the street .
as for the main plate .
it ' s old oil !
i did the burger challenge .
the basic is 0 x 0/0 lb patties .
no bad bad bad .
atmosphere : 0.0 / 0 .
0 if they were not so new .
` ` <UNK> ' ' they were called .
a bit over medium .
guest 0 had veggie burger sub fries for salad .
that timing is great for <UNK> lunch crowds .
service , location , and value .
just a minor issue .
- eat at the top of the rock restaurant .
i enjoy doing obstacle course racing .
it is ok for what it is .
it was not worth the price of admission .
i am talking about any harrah ' s properties .
i ' ve been back about 0 times .
0 stars for pricing and value .
one of my favorite mariscos joints in the valley .
` ` the devil ' s in the details .
this place is great !
the food is absolutely amazing .
this was a very interesting place .
all the staff were extremely friendly and hospitable .
not really , but it was a good day .
and i took 0/0 of my order home .
good dim sum in vegas ?
but it is good here .
hey where are the yelp reviews of this place ?
there are some rough looking big dudes .
that special exists at special times .
salt but no <UNK> here ... please ' ' .
this is basically the restaurant for lucky casino .
english is the second language , however .
it ' s quality that makes me come back .
this new beautiful casino has several new restaurants .
my nephew had the full rack of ribs .
bad for the seniors to make that change .
it backs all the flights up .
and screws up connections for a lot of people .
this is a typical krispy kreme donut store .
everything else is pretty much the same .
they still have <UNK> opportunities and wholesale sales .
. beer was $ 0 .
this particular ihop in north las vegas in convenient .
with home brewed french roast coffee .
they activated the cards and i was almost done .
they have a very nice deli and butcher well .
since it was 000 <UNK> .
overall this was a quick and easy experience .
then you microwave and serve per instructions .
my doc , a very skinny dude .
not a single guy was wearing a tie .
being off the strip is great and horrible .
they charge $ 00 a day for internet access .
medical care was excellent .
they started building this just as the recession started .
checkout was 0 minutes tops .
simpler is sometimes way better .
gardening in the desert climate is a challenge .
they have the stuff to do it .
there were lots of decent , efficient checkers .
the waiting rooms were n't very clean or comfortable .
my brother order a hamburger .
i swear some people get three or four plates .
whatever i tried was good .
he is a former accountant after all .
coke was $ 0.00 .
lots of sad faces throughout that casino .
probably not a great night for gambling .
but it was a decent meal for the price .
did they have the nerve to fire above midget ?
my rating is a 0.0 .
their display case looked pretty good .
this is for the buffet only at texas station .
my relatives come here to gamble .
it must be about 000 feet long .
most everything was good .
it was time to gamble before heading home .
<UNK> <UNK> is run by the mormon church .
there is good lighting .
however , few of their stuff was new .
not a bad operation at all .
lots of managers were on hand to resolve problems .
we did like some of the old disco tunes .
the food was a hit .
mike is a former hs <UNK> also .
but most people had pho .
no matter what day , it is crowded .
! ! the front door suddenly bursts open .
for what they are , they do fairly well .
yeah , you ' re gambling superman .
sometimes , they ' ll have shrimp creole .
so how did we manage that ?
` ` ok ' ' i told him .
and it would be <UNK> for this place .
average price was about $ 0.00 each .
he did admit later that was the case .
so easily in a carpeted room .
that ' s the same wherever you go .
and that ' s often what i order .
it is a clean and attractive mall .
$ 00 before tip for all that .
i ' ll be back .
that was almost strike three .
i ' d give it 0.0 stars rounded up .
<UNK> meal was perhaps 0.0 stars .
our meals were enhanced by the beers on tap .
the biggest problem is their service .
thank you dr . <UNK> .
a shining light in this dump of a hotel .
so worth the travel off the strip .
ca n't lose with this place .
anytime someone visits this is on the agenda .
a / c controls were old <UNK> style .
no regrets in selection of show for the night .
though the pool looked like it was well maintained .
parking was still very difficult .
overall , sub-par embassy suites experience .
still a decent place to stay .
was a great show powered by great music .
definitely gets your blood flowing and body moving .
this place is great .
saturday was a train wreck .
my advice , look elsewhere .
definetly kicks you awake .
after that i had ordered a aoili burgr .
had a very bad experience here .
it is at most a 0 star .
quality is nowhere to be found .
pass the word on .
i went here saturday , 00/0 / 00 .
this place is dead .
updated - no electric bill from <UNK> after all .
my recommendation ... pork sandwich .
get <UNK> at grinders .
what ' s wrong with upper management of airlines ?
00/00 would recommend to try .
gf : how about 0 kegs ?
me : what do they have there ?
gf : <UNK> and other staff .
cheap and for a good reason .
most likely the <UNK> will rise as well .
cant beat it with a stick .
lets just say that i expected more then received .
so no big loss there .
the casino at the plaza is ok .
drink service was good .
as homer simpson says <UNK> .
the casino so nice , they named it twice .
they ' re all just boxes to gamble in .
unless they have a theme to lure me in .
this might be my favorite casino in the world .
no local ` <UNK> to be perused .
where cheese is king !
a cheddar sandwich should be impossible to mess up .
the sushi was relatively rocking .
at least in this case .
i had the chicken panang and it was fantastic .
<UNK> is part of the reason why .
some fairly talented staff , although heavy on attitude .
customer service after the sale was a complete disaster .
reasonable prices is a plus too .
iphone repair pros ... good prices and quick <UNK> .
i have taken my vehicles here on several occassions .
it will be a challenging round of golf .
this is really a great sports bar .
<UNK> ! ! ! complete and total <UNK> .
went here to watch the college national champ game .
cool place to hang out .
went there for a business lunch .
was a cool place to eat in vegas .
then i went back to gambling .
went to the cigar side and wow !
the fans are strong but not loud .
there is limited seating so get there early .
very nice restaurant with great sushi .
if you are in pittsburgh and you like beer .
this is the only place you need to go .
great sandwiches and they are open 00 hours .
you can get better entertainment by watching street performers .
they seem to have forgotten that .
the <UNK> is obnoxious .
this place is the real deal .
super cheap for the strip .
i hate you , <UNK> <UNK> guy !
this place is a must when in vegas .
so what are you doing ?
reasonably priced for where it is .
pretty cool place , but hella crowded .
probably the best way to get around the strip .
needless to say , the answer was no .
ok , no big deal .
the staff are knowledgeable about everything on their shelves .
the coffee was great .
no tv ' s to watch sports , either .
two were great , but the cubano ?
all good , right ?
the roxy roll was the complete opposite however .
the dining room never feels cluttered .
the only negative here is service sometimes .
the server was friendly but forgettable .
service was good but not exceptional .
for the price you ca n't beat it though .
drinks average $ 00-00 .
service is decent even at peak times .
the short answer is no .
no expense was spared in design or materials .
ok this sex stuff caused me to digress .
visited the chandelier a few times and bond .
the av was top notch .
free wifi ! ! take note other vegas hotels .
it ' s fast as hell too .
free wifi was a plus .
it ' s one word - fresh .
the place was absolutely packed , a great surprise .
it will be super rocking .
go for the beer and eat in advance .
nice atmosphere and beer menu .
i lived in phx for 00 years .
this place is simply the best in phx .
calling your order in advance is a must .
manager said , that was a mistake .
thanks hertz for ensuring my entire experience was poor .
the stadium has plenty of easy parking .
they had a 0 beer selection .
the service was very good as well .
the preparation was fine and the presentation was excellent .
ok , this trip has been ridiculous .
and then they work slower than molasses flowing uphill .
ill take it into consideration .
' ' what the hell is that ?
if you want sushi , go to the bellagio .
that is about where the great service stopped .
my favourite uptown bar .
chose the moussaka and an espresso .
stopped here for a light lunch before flying home .
do you want to do to go ?
cheese steak sandwich was ordered with the works .
cheese and wine ... pasta 0 cheeses amazing ! !
the 0 - meat and veggie are great .
then , the foie gras poutine .
up to now , great .
then , the duck in a can .
and i probably will , soon enough .
pizza was marginal at best .
ordered the wagyu rib eye .
the inside had the consistency and texture of sushi .
only place open 00 hours near dt .
health department should take a look at this .
as far as the prices ... .
is this like a college bar ?
these guys are awesome .
extremely helpful and knowledgeable .
please execute this one better .
they were all good , not uniquely great .
customer service was quite good .
buy into the hype ?
please come back to henderson soon , <UNK> !
lighting is fairly muted .
on to the food .
the fifth star is for the <UNK> .
not bad for the new kid on the block .
it was pretty solid .
sadly , it did n't meet expectations .
the display is quite a sight to behold .
yes , that ' s 00 choices .
any lower would just be <UNK> .
i ' ll have to look that up later .
in a word , awesome .
the tonkotsu ramen was fantastic .
believe the hype , guys .
i had the gyros deluxe and the falafel gyros .
large trays of meats are available for advance order .
that makes up for the other shortcomings easily .
maybe i ' ll find it in the future .
there are no words , to describe it .
there are a lot of references and <UNK> .
yeah , we may have succumbed to this oversight .
nobu is a name with weight .
others may find that service useful .
fat daddy ' s is one of them .
the first thing that came to mind was in-n-out .
the truffle parmesan fries were also excellent .
none of the other <UNK> worked that well .
they were all tired from the long drive .
brownie points for the <UNK> marks .
0 - rrb - mr . ho ' s .
all burgers really should be enjoyed medium-rare .
hey , every other lunch spot in the neighborhood .
so , the show .
lots of great live music .
one of the largest interiors i ' ve seen .
service : consistent pacing throughout the night .
glad i made this my <UNK> ` <UNK> choice .
not bad , but not great .
well , except the drive from henderson .
in most respects , it did .
the large , flat crouton was a solid accompaniment .
<UNK> for saving drafts .
you ' ll see why very shortly .
and what a place it is .
the neighborhood here has a much safer feel too .
those two seem to be the most promising .
the beef rib was really good .
my visit was n't a perfect experience .
in a very good way .
this bbq joint definitely lives up to the hype .
rollin smoke deserves more of my visits .
this place has to be the <UNK> of vons .
let ' s cut to the chase .
the pizza just seemed pretty bland .
surprisingly , they delivered .
still , it ' s worth the trip .
everybody else went with medium .
yeah , they were n't kidding .
the nigiri was solid .
the first was , well , real donuts .
little bit larger than normal donuts .
the lychee sorbet and balsamic were standouts .
will have to investigate further .
the <UNK> ones were n't so special .
but when i do , i prefer something good .
they are worth an order .
oh well , live and learn .
las vegas arts district .
friend ' s unfinished whiskey , straight .
there will be a next time .
that was n't that short .
an <UNK> could just be waiting to happen .
brief but important update .
simplicity at its best .
service and sushi preparation were both brisk and attentive .
<UNK> , not entirely lost .
it was as good as i ' d remembered .
one of the biggest tourist traps around .
forget about denny ' s and its <UNK> .
the fall from grace might be starting .
they replaced it with ham .
back to five stars .
i would avoid it .
the graham dusting was a nice touch .
i mean , wow .
you might even call it artisan .
if that was your guess , great job .
the real standout here is the atmosphere .
as an aside , i do n't get it .
the service was spotty at times .
speaking of which , service was pretty solid .
your mileage may vary .
having said that , i did have some issues .
still no word from doors .
stick to tacos el gordo for <UNK> .
they ' re an absolute necessity .
<UNK> has earned it .
well worth it , as i ' ll explain .
take what you can get , i suppose .
that ' s enough for five stars from me .
best ayce sushi menu hack ever .
it ' s definitely the real deal .
i ' ve seen worse arcades for sure .
i ' m no ramen guy .
color me a fan .
what i tasted was absolute <UNK> .
they served their purpose .
i will certainly be back .
this is a sandwich review .
the banh mi thit nuong is way better .
top 00 in vegas ?
they ' ll ask which starch you want .
anyway , this pretty much saved the average .
food court review only .
is review about specific items .
is menu with many <UNK> .
is probably worth returning to try other items .
birthday dinner for one at tony roma ' s ?
i ' d feel comfortable with coming back .
i thought it was a 0/0 .
frankly , this place did n't meet expectations .
had a friendly gathering of six people last night .
for now , a solid four stars .
everything is tender , and i mean everything .
- rsb - time for an update .
steak shawarma was a letdown .
seems like a nice local hangout .
everybody looked like they were having a good time .
i saw some unlv <UNK> .
- rrb - and therefore out of place .
fat choy is very , very cool .
chalk up another five-star review .
the new great 00/0 breakfast place on the strip !
pretty nice place to eat at .
you ' ll love it .
great mussels baked with cheese - lrb - mozzarella ?
oh yeah , i like the neighborhood vibe .
the lunch was quite satisfying overall .
the unagi nigiri was also good as expected .
stay tuned , folks .
many would enjoy the novelty of these tools .
unfortunately , not all vendors would embrace small tapioca .
this brings significant hope for the future .
more info on that ... never .
the food is pretty decent .
this is one place where you should .
salmon belly is often available .
soyo is a korean restaurant in southwest las vegas .
- bbq sauce was pretty mediocre .
my omelet was just good .
very classic american feel to the place .
what kinda business are they running ?
the baklava is a fairly small triangle .
it was a little bit disappointing .
the prime rib was pretty solid .
or a <UNK> sushi place .
old reviews may not reflect the current business .
it ' s still a nice touch .
i expected to pay sales tax , but nope .
shape up , guys .
the strip mall is only accessible on russell .
inside , the design definitely resembles bachi 0.0 .
- rrb - surprise , surprise .
the second is this sort of fabric roof .
- lrb - spoiler alert : it <UNK> .
not sure where to start with this .
not much else to say .
again , everything was good .
heavily <UNK> , especially in the featured meats .
nothing especially good or bad here .
some pieces have more heat than others .
there are only two choices in this area .
the food was also solid .
i went for the $ 0.00 0 oz .
guess i was wrong on that .
would ' ve served them right .
i was very fortunate to stumble upon them today .
not a problem for me on this day .
i went ahead and did the latter .
finally got to experience the heart attack last night .
my first slider was the pulled porky .
next up : pep pep .
final slider was the captain ' s order .
the beef carpaccio came out next .
these guys are absolutely amazing .
guess what , folks ?
i accepted the challenge .
oh yes , it rained during the first night .
they shut down all the cameras for safety purposes .
` ` a-ok ' ' is about right .
ketchup can cover for that issue too .
google it or something .
it was quite nice .
with one small exception , it did not disappoint .
four pieces of cornish hen .
surprisingly , that was it .
i was seated after a short wait .
i do n't know what else to say .
the burger was great .
in comes big wong to the rescue , right ?
what an absolute revelation .
it ' s all about wing tuesdays , man .
this was like twice as bad .
carnitas was essentially diced pork and tasted of pork .
- found a cockroach crawling up the wall .
- rrb - in relatively short order after asking .
the visual is impressive .
this is my second time here .
- rrb - must be getting a great deal .
it was a <UNK> .
they ' ve earned it .
once again , they <UNK> .
i did not make the same request .
big props for that .
well , i guess a park is wild enough .
i ' m gon na lean toward the latter .
never been to the original place .
you should visit buldogis cafe as well .
you ' ll love this place .
the other reviews got it right .
they deserve a bigger lunch crowd .
attempt # 0 was today .
after some <UNK> , we went here .
the other sandwiches are just $ 0.00 .
the green started off with a decent reggae set .
not a bad choice .
it was certainly a good first impression .
another person had the pulled pork sandwich .
both were excellent , imo .
' ' i parked at harrah ' s .
yes , duck meat in a buffet .
overall , it was good , solid italian food .
it ' s not spectacular , but solid .
juicy burgers , fresh ingredients , all that jazz .
the bbq duck was excellent .
it ' s a shame .
the thai fried chicken tacos were better .
it left quite a good feeling in my mouth .
it is , in a word , satisfying .
our russian was definitely impressed though .
not a <UNK> destination though .
surprised that nobody has written about this .
salmon and ikura don was great .
i had a medium - lrb - ?
check these guys out when you can .
i ' m not that much of a <UNK> .
they would probably go well with gravy .
the best part is that the shows are free .
it ' s worked well for me twice now .
or just <UNK> to the bottom .
the burger was a treat .
forgot to ask about the scallop , whoops !
superman and monkey burritos are both nice .
also managed to try some <UNK> rolls .
good , maybe not great though .
serviceable given that they ' re not goyemon .
now for the <UNK> series of bad news .
this order appeared pale and even gray .
in short , they have improved .
surprisingly good food all around .
you should see it on the right .
i ' m going to come back .
it ' s good , but not exceptional .
this rating is heavily weighted toward the music .
the rest of the components saved it .
go for the music if you go at all .
it is not something that i personally care about .
these guys did n't .
fortunately , i had much more to go on .
. best wings ever ?
as i said before , service was terrific .
best al pastor i have had yet .
- rrb - - cabeza : tender head meat .
- lrb - funny story with that al pastor .
anyway , back to the rundown .
- <UNK> : beef shoulder .
this place meets all the criteria .
the service is reasonably fast .
funny thing is that it was n't quick .
good , not great or anything .
nobody else forgets part of the order ever .
there are far better options out there .
rice crackers with soy and wasabi flavorings .
yellowtail and scallop , shared .
# 0 : seafood cold dish .
# 0 : fried food .
# 0 : beef .
# 00 : <UNK> .
i went into left field with the burger .
neither choice can be mistaken for gourmet or premium .
despite some flaws , the meal was great .
i could see myself returning soon .
the regular rice is served in a bowl .
no issues with either .
it ' s a real shame .
expect to wait 0-00 minutes sans line .
this place is legit .
worse yet , it was bland .
time to talk about the food ?
it ' s well worth it though .
like the roast beef , it cooks really quickly .
it ' s good but not special .
the asian bbq pork was also good .
the onion dip chip appetizer was good .
they cleaned it and i was wtf ?
the carne asada tasted great .
the cashier told me they ran out .
they get kudos for having so many seats inside .
looks like they have n't cleaned it for while .
good food , good music .
clearly this location is of the same standards .
there is sushi available and it looks ok .
what a good find in the bellagio .
so let ' s talk about service .
the room was decent .
the exercise room was decent .
i usually get the coleslaw too with my meal .
it would make a killing where i live .
service can differ , of course .
the biscuits and gravy were very tasty and meaty .
nevertheless , the waffle is a good alternative .
the salami scramble was so unique and different .
if you like salami , i recommend .
had the rustica and the pepperoni pizza .
food here is fantastic , hands down .
nothing in the room went well .
come here and try this you cant regret it .
the sushi was grocery store quality and cold .
it ' s a mexican bar and restaurant .
in this case , nothing .
service and atmosphere is always great .
that price is a whopping $ 00 .
be sure and tip well .
that ' s the key word here .
come on yelp , let us give half stars !
please educate yourself before making <UNK> criticisms .
the best italian sub out there .
all meats are high quality and cut to order .
get it mike ' s way .
sala thai is definitely worth checking out .
think of a tamale lasagna with <UNK> pork filling .
the adovada ribs are excellent as well .
the taste , sublime .
this is the place .
great food from a independent .
i hope its good .
awesome food , awesome service and awesome ambience .
no issues that i encountered .
jeff brooks is his name .
0.0 - lrb - but ca n't put that .
so come in , give it a try .
this place is 0 stars and no more .
it just does n't click .
try this place , and see for yourself .
would probably come again .
solid place solid food .
solid place , needs to smooth out rough edges .
with a few tv ' s in the building .
but not on days like this .
- rrb - a lot of tv ' s .
why 0 stars you ask ?
but great staff and worth a try .
i had the classic stromboli .
keep up the good work .
overall a must try .
service beats zoyo any day !
the brisket is amazing .
come on out and give em a try .
he recommended a good beer from italy .
hats off to the owner and the crew .
be aware of this place .
go here , be amazed .
a bit pricey for what you get .
not bad for lunch .
cheers service great , pizza great .
amazing wait staff , amazing hospitality .
avoid at all costs .
these people deserve to be fired .
the main breaking point for me was the crowding .
a very talented and impressive community of performers .
it ' s an old train car style diner .
it is what it is .
<UNK> it ' s a phoenix institution .
you ' ve lost you ' re la privileges .
the space is large and open with great decoration .
first off the service was bad .
best tacos in vegas .
screw it i decided to leave .
the room was very good and staff was pleasant .
i ' m being honest .
the amenities here , first off , are great .
this place is a must see .
nice open area to smoke with plenty of room .
the problem is , it is just too expensive .
one of the best theaters in the valley .
this place was really hard for me to rate .
the thing is its a crap shoot going here .
such a shame what happened here really .
i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys zoos .
here is the thing .
the other thing was the lack of draft selection .
nowadays everyone has a good tap selection .
on this given night i saw an awesome show .
i understand an upsell , but really a <UNK> ?
it is a nice clean , dine in theater .
they also have very good <UNK> .
nice layout to the place .
- security does a great job here .
the service was good for the most .
the rooms were nice and sizable .
awesome little place dipped off in the esplanade .
worst airport in the area .
the sliders and turkey sand were great .
no it has to be me .
chris ' s # 000-000-0000 .
had to get a tow for my car .
they damaged my car door and windshield .
refuse to take responsibility .
- rrb - lo-lo ' s delivered .
no one in my group was really impressed .
the problem lies with the horrible service .
great atmosphere i love going to this place .
awesome food and even better beer .
this is the spot right here .
you wo n't be disappointed .
this place is on point .
this place used to be good wtf happened ?
food was great and reasonably priced with restaurant.com coupon .
go to ups next door .
they said this would all coast about $ 000.00 .
seems like a tourist spot to me .
the food had a true italian flare to it .
not to mention the acrobats are outstanding .
it is definitely worth the hype .
i had a simple chicken fajita sandwich .
this place is dirty .
this is one of the place in our <UNK> .
this is a very disorganized place .
` ` no sir this is it .
i am trying that next time .
five guys , smashburger and fatburger .
five guys was the worst of the three .
smashburger and fatburger do burgers and fries better .
yup , this location has closed .
great pizza at a good price .
super friendly crew working at this location .
i like sharks , <UNK> , and aquariums ... .
dine-in orders usually take ~ 00 minutes .
the gym is really nice , but $ 00 ?
shuttle buses run very often .
you ' ll get sand in everything .
if not ... you ' ll lose it .
this is the subway from the twilight zone .
- lrb - the bomb - rrb - .

and fuel was just that .
overall it was a great hot dog .
great beers on tap .
pizza joint next store is great for food .

its pricey but great place .
very clean and it ' s a nice place .

on their menu it says $ 00 minimum .
we found that insane so never ordered .
on their menu it says $ 00 minimum .
we found that insane so never ordered .
sales guys were <UNK> .
people in the service department were great .
i will never buy a car from here again .
if you want to see a movie it works .
best prices , they have everything .
chop chop is my go to neighborhood chinese spot .
. needed something filling , quick and somewhat healthy .
- rrb - easy ordering and price is reasonable .
portions well enough for two meals .
this place is great .
price is reasonable as well .
the spicy beef noodle was a huge portion .
great little atmosphere as well .
got the ultimate wash for 00.00 .
i would avoid this location at all cost .
i ' ll be back .
i spent $ 0 and walked away very satisfied .
at $ 0 an entree this is very affordable .
service : could have been better .
every need was filled immediately .
these are not huge heaping plates .
they are artful servings of great handcrafted food .
otherwise , prepare to be seriously <UNK> .
the service was also quite good .
free wifi is <UNK> for the password .
very pleasant and helpful staff .
that is if hallmark sold adult books .

must try the oxtail empanadas .
i ordered the combination chicken and beef kabobs .

i ca n't recommend this place enough .
several <UNK> can also be found here .
great attentive friendly service .
had the tako salad which was a bit salty .
not <UNK> to ask for refill 0x .
forget about the overpriced fancy buffet along the strip .
everything is <UNK> staff to service and the food .
minor renovation was on going during my stay .
newspaper is not free .
wifi is free comes in and out at times .
nothing to complain about .
the place was clean and free of pesky flies .
the seats has speaker for surround sound effect .
worth the line and the $ $ .
the place has only a banner for a <UNK> .
service is courteous and fast .
the overall rating of the place is a 0 .
the rooms are clean and maintained .
location is just right besides hooters casino .
its a self paced tour .
the impersonators are hit and miss .
some are just boring and flat .
the <UNK> were the life of the show .
the place is <UNK> packed on weekends .
nothing remarkable about the food being served .
all are staples in a typical <UNK> fare .
sells everything asian particularly filipino made products .
the corned beef was good .
ca n't go wrong here .
great dim sum place inside the gold coast casino .
the place could be cleaner .
tasty , beef burger and awesome shakes !
get your tickets online .
service - very poor .

everything was served amazingly fresh with the utmost quality .
good lord ... the buffet was also surprisingly clean .
service was beyond anything i have ever experienced .
bless you , good sir .

what else do you need to prove ?
we went to midas on serene near the walmart .
same problem : same results .
auto tech 0 less is the best !
you are just out of luck .
this is one of my favorite taco places .
the best just got better .
this is a thinking man ' s bar .
this place is <UNK> and not very good .
south side steaks 0 .
thanks , fajitas ! ! your honesty is exemplary .
great place to eat while waiting for your flight .
this place was outstanding .

great place for breakfast .
great place very nice upscale resturant with great location .
staff is always knowledgeable , and even excellent .
great atmosphere and the coffee is awesome too .
let the professionals do it for you .

the staff is all great and very nice .
they even do free tire rotation with the service .
there ' s 0 rides that they operate .
this is a wild one at night .
crowded as a <UNK> .
cause you can barely move .
both times , fail due to rain .
went down to get a drink .
wont be a 0rd .
cost : $ 00.00 .
tacos & tequila - great mexican joint .
what stood out to me was their staff .
serious waste of time .
waste of $ $ $ $ .
valet dude was polite .
0/0 because i have had much better .
they do score some points .
<UNK> ... tacos & tequila is expensive .
orders are quick and service done with a smile .
do n't forget to ask for a membership card !
this can not be said for the <UNK> drinks .
i think 0 star <UNK> dang is sufficiently spicy .
a big bunch of <UNK> to them .
they will say one thing , and do another .
problems - - these may well be growing pains .
it has a more modern yet still western feel .
beautiful outdoor patio and view of the golf course .
could n't explain why that would be beneficial .
<UNK> is cheaper and fully covered by my insurance .
<UNK> is thinner too .
plenty of tvs to catch the games .
can food and service make you weep ?
good food , good ambiance .
good experience on the whole .
building is old but good food .
this review is long over due .
then had to have a second plain one .
it was great by itself .
the ambiance of the place is hip and comfortable .
great service and staff .
i ca n't recommend this place enough .
worth trying and definitely worth returning .
the majority of people ordered pizzas or pasta entries .
these guys are the opposite of that .
these guys are the opposite of that .
it does n't get any better .
this place is absolutely terrible .
<UNK> is your client for life .
the atmosphere was 0 stars .
nothing to complain about here .
- rrb - the food is garbage .
- rrb - this is my final reason .
the bacon was awesome .
the only problem i have is the ice machine .
the ice machine is broken .
i am on the <UNK> tower .
i arrived to paris las vegas around 0:00 pm .
i did see a couple people in suits .
i met an asian bartender named aaron .
it was wonderful to be at a local hangout .
this yard house vibe was excellent .
the wait for the food was about ten minutes .
we stroke a small conversation and steve came back .
they assign me the <UNK> towers , room 000 .
i knew i had to fill me up .
parking garage 0 is the the worst .
there are <UNK> all over the place .
why do people do that in the parking garage ?
. no supply and high demand .
things have changed so much .
not sure what that was about .
office hours are from 000am to 00pm .
it ' s time to share it .
this is a very classy place .
that will be on another review .
the biltmore is simply amazing .
that somewhat ruined the experience .
oh well , its america ' s national <UNK> .
where are you traveling today ?
i found the lodge .
the <UNK> burger was damn amazing .
i did finish by the way .
that <UNK> burger was just overwhelming .
almost thought i accidentally found a vip area .
now that ' s class .

all i saw was nothing .
. a big nothing .
now , it is dead quiet .
how is this business even running ?
where are you traveling today ?
<UNK> to costco at the phoenix <UNK> spectrum mall .
costco killed the other food court competitions .
this review is for 00/00 / 0000 .
it was $ 0 for one cape cod .
it is a cool place to be .
probably do window <UNK> or install aftermarket items .
oh yeah , mesa market serves $ 0 beers !
the one stop place for your everyday research !
the bus that arrived was the double decker bus .
lunch ends around 0:00 pm .
- lrb - 0.00 cents extra - rrb - .
there were even more when i left .
well , you can call me a <UNK> !
i had arrived after business hours .
also , free wi-fi with provided password .
this is an ok place to stay .
the corn beef hash was below average to average .
the convention center has many floors with many <UNK> .
i was greeted by one of the staff .
you might step on trash and slip .
the one stop place for your everyday research !
it is very interesting .
walking to the casino is very easy .
plenty of parking for small cars to huge <UNK> .
well , you can call me a <UNK> !
you can <UNK> the park if you need to .
it ' s time to share it .
microbrewery at its finest .
nicely done with the new beers guys .
after about 00 minutes our order was finally ready .
decided to go to smashburger with my bro .
food was amazing , everything rocked .
awesome nachos and all other tex-mex food .
to my knowledge it does not exist .
the dinner selection has some nice <UNK> .
there are better places to eat for the $ .
its a great hotel off the strip .
thats a good deal for an upscale hotel .
although it tends to fall apart .
the staff is cool and friendly .
this is not $ $ sushi .
it ' s a strip mall gyro shop .
middle of the road .
just a gyro pita should be .
the food is tops .
i got a gyro , as per usual .
it ' s fucking great .
yeah , i ' ll take that deal .
they are amazeballs ! ! 0 .
two tacos for a dollar .
never mind which mike i ' m talking about .
not a bad deal at all .
we were ushered in like the place just opened .
jeez ... i really wanted to like this place .
i ordered the pastrami burger combo .
i got my order and away i went .
still , my hunger <UNK> <UNK> this .
disappointment began to replace the hunger <UNK> .
my tongue and throat called it a tie .
appointments , and <UNK> .
i walked into a pretty nice sized waiting room .
do your job in a professional manner please .
the food is decent here .
the prices was very good .
the star of the meal was the noodles .
easily takes 00 min to get a drink .
some of the best sushi in charlotte .
very nice and professional , almost too nice ha .
ca n't complain , there guys are good !
the service is n't bad either .
greg was quick to see me and treat me .
good service , good atmosphere , good price .
all in all a great time .
handful of bbq vendors and hardly any bbq samples .
pretty good chill out spot on montford .
thanks rob we appreciate your work !
glad to have found these guys .
parking is fantastic in the parking deck .
nice starbucks on the way out .
nice gym ... small and limited equipment .
the apartment itself is amazing .
some people have commented on the noise level .
the food is solid .
on my first visit the service was 0 stars .
thus a 0-0 star review dropped down to 0 .
this is my go-to post office in charlotte .
overall i would give between 0 and 0 stars .
very airy and open .
could be a lot better .
thus the 0.0 stars .
best to plan ahead and make a reservation .
i could have done much better on my own .
the atmosphere and dining area is great .
much better than a panera .
it has a great homey feeling .
parking in the back is a plus .
no lines , no hassle !
not the cheapest , but a great value .
the theater is very dated .
this newer location at <UNK> is fantastic .
only drawback is the parking in the <UNK> deck .
simply stated , i ' ll never return .
wonder what they did on friday ?
what an absolutely phenomenal find .
like being back home .
very standard fare but consistently good .
the items on the brunch menu were excellent .
excellent repair work and easy to work with
although it did full up later .
i had the surf and turf .
i will be back for sure .
the restaurant is divey and run down .
the performance was outstanding .
for the most part i enjoyed the show .
every beer i tasted was well above average .
the jalapeã ± o wit also outstanding !
all of their beers were drinkable .
the pilsner and pale ale were also enjoyable .
over all , a pretty good place .
worth a second trip , no doubt .
i mean , even motel 0 has coffee makers !
excellent sushi and reasonable prices .
nothing comes into his restaurant without his approval .
this place was suprisingly good .
this place is awesome .
what to eat for dinner ?
actually , it ' s pretty simple .
i text my buddy dave and it was on .
food was awesome , service was almost non <UNK> .
i empty plated <UNK> all of it .
where i had an issue was the service .
i recently stopped in to check the place out .
they have food from all over tapas style .
european , spanish , bulgarian , russian and <UNK> .
i joined the empty plate club no problem .
it gets my first and only 0 star rating .
so , in summary , good food .
the sodium content does catch up with you .
ambiance : <UNK> english tavern feel .
random ass soundtrack playing too .
professional , courteous , and friendly staff .
helped order contacts at a very good price .
tables not <UNK> quick .
the <UNK> is very good .
the portions are a bit large for chop sticks .
staff was friendly and service was fairly prompt .
ok , now i ' ll tell you why .
the service is very good .
the waiters are courteous and attentive .
the food was excellent and the service was attentive .
the clientele was the only drawback on my visit .
i recommend him to anyone .
i would highly recommend them to anyone .
the place was nice .
my gf was very happy .
great people , great place .
i have not played golf for over five years .
which improve my range .
went to the driving range after to celebrate .
but the breakfast spread is typically nice marriott food .
always have a great meal and great service .
that ' s a steep price for a drink .
great service even during lunch .
a great place in a surprising location .
give it a shot .
this was n't the case here .
it was all very good .
try them out and you will not regret it .
0 stars for steve .
anthony is a great guy .
the rest of the menu is just ok .
<UNK> and the courier burger are among their best .
by far , the best resturant in <UNK> .
its <UNK> tapas variety food venue .
so i went back for the leaks .
this place is amazing .
the owner is such a nice guy .
my wife and i recently discovered this place .
i try to stop here once a paycheck .
definitely worth your time to check this place out .
plus , <UNK> is across the street .
went there for lunch today .
service was great and the comedy was top notch .
bellagio staff went above and beyond .
this goes on for about 00 minutes .
needed power steering fluid to boot .
they will work ya over - think <UNK> .
food , service and atmosphere .
like this place a lot .
the food was amazing .
the owner and his wife are fantastic people .
these guys did an amazing job !
prompt , professional and courteous .
amazing value in their service .
will only use these guys in the future .
the gyros combo meal is a good deal .
amazing service with informed and <UNK> staff .
trying to give up pizza ?
here is some inspiration .
the pizza here has super powers .
i find this term to be entirely <UNK> .
what does natural mean ?
again , it is good not great .
think of these as a <UNK> , wonton soup .
dim sum or lazy man ' s buffet ?
the service was attentive and efficient without being uncomfortable .
the john <UNK> <UNK> portions here are insane .
for me , this is a no-no .
the food was good , not great .
the food was bland at best .
i have very mixed feelings about my uni experience .
are there better burgers in las vegas ?
overpriced and <UNK> ... .
when it did arrive , i was fairly disappointed .
my experience there was n't all bad .
i went with the shredded beef tacos .
would you go to a discount heart surgeon ?
the country style ribs were very good .
i actually think its better than potbelly ' s .
the problem was the horrific <UNK> that poured out .
this dingy dive stop will not disappoint .
this place has <UNK> potential .
tiramisu - not bad , but nothing special either .
' ' ok , maybe the norm too .
- lrb - do you know the movie ?
they had two for one beers , all beers .
much less <UNK> and much better music .
if only the whole place were like this .
not a big deal , but not good service .
sammy ' s pizza is <UNK> .
very straightforward and satisfying .
<UNK> falls in this category .
<UNK> is in the infant stages of greatness .
the meatball sandwich - amazing .
the service was fine enough .
the coffee was very fresh and quite good though .
i went with the bbq pork sandwich .
such freedom for a little kid .
i ordered a burger and fries , very basic .
they played a lot of relaxed , contemporary jazz .
well done flamingo dmv , well done .
come here for the beer and the ambience .
poker machines - 0 stars it took my money .
how is there a line when nobody shops here ?
it was very good .
' ' the maple pork belly was also incredible .
the crowds here are the issue i have .
you ca n't beat the value here .
like using ketchup on spaghetti .
the service was fine as well .
` ` <UNK> is the hardest part .
the decor is nice here .
the food - good stuff in general .
everyone who comes here gets crabs !
great group of guys making good food .
<UNK> - salty , fast food fries .
- rrb - makes for great people watching .
pei wei is a mystery to me .
they ' re missing the point here .
chopped salad - what was he thinking ?
a very good <UNK> .
the service was spectacular , the food , phenomenal .
i love dw bistro , and so do you .
you just may not not know it yet .
hands down my favorite place in las vegas .
a seafood place with questionable seafood .
plan on ordering 0-0 tacos depending on your appetite .
everything you want in a vegas performance .
the quality is solid .
not too long and a spectacular finish .
a must see when visiting .
but great bang for the buck .
tell them michael sent you .
main st / charleston .
00 minutes passed , nothing yet .
excellent job for a decent price .
year another fantastic set of dishes from cafe bink .
service was helpful and nice .
p . s . try the bbq bites .
this is a good budget hotel .
probably an expensive cab ride .
the only problem i had was when i arrived .
i was in the north wing .
it ' s a <UNK> pork dish .
bachi burger is a great place for hamburgers .
the term gourmet hamburger is often <UNK> .
but the term really applies at bachi burger .
the pepper in the <UNK> <UNK> fries are jalapenos .
the garlic aoili sauce was pretty good .
the burger was great .
the gruyere cheese was tasty .
nothing seemed to stand out .
the place has a nice feeling .
and it ' s cheap .
and it was fantastic on the fusion tostada .
my experience with ramen is limited .
that was n't the case here .
it seems like a winner .
it seems quite popular .
especially artifacts from the nevada test site .
thousands of <UNK> saw the tests .
the poor reviews are deserved .
there was n't that much interesting to see .
just average politeness would be appreciated .
it might be near the top .
the two entrees we split were both excellent .
all the seafood seemed fresh and was not overcooked .
this is a review for the motel .
it seems that conditions are improving under days inn .
look at it as a cheap place to stay .
the food is average .
the service was friendly and that helped .
<UNK> ' s <UNK> is an excellent deli .
<UNK> ' s is still a great place .
service was excellent at <UNK> ' s too .
this is a a fantastic restaurant .
the jack mackerel had an especially strong sardine taste .
not as strong as the jack mackerel or <UNK> .
and the service was excellent .
it was at least slightly fishy tasting .
that was different and excellent .
plus the place is kind of fun .
the place has good energy .
it was also well done .
the ambiance is what did it for me .
the service here was great .
third , the service was the worst .
plenty of big screen sports .
dam good sushi here .
great ambiance at this place .
great food , great service and low prices .
what else can you ask for .
one of the best places in vegas .
the staff was attentive without being invasive .
i started with the escargot .
but hey slow service is very french .
i had the <UNK> drink .
the foie gras was good .
the mozzarella dish was nice and simple .
the tuna was a hit .
the sriracha mayo with it was perfect .
the mac and cheese was good ... not great .
i recommend this place .
good place for a drink .
best place to go .
the staff could be a little friendlier .
<UNK> bbq and five guys famous burgers and fries .
awesome , <UNK> products ?
what made this location the worst was the service .
how can you beat it ?
this is a tricky one .
thanks again for all your hard work !
best not to watch ' em .
i did a search and called this place up .
mark is a really cool guy and professional .
walking in the garage was pretty awesome .
he understood and gave me their business card .
you guys should know : safety .
i filled up a sick motorcycle <UNK> here .
the room : nice , clean and modern standard .
check-out was a smidge longer than i thought .
also stocked with towels , water and tv .
service from the 0 gentleman bartenders was decent .
i found the monorail to be of great use .
thanks <UNK> w for the invite and setup .
good stuff , man !
food is difficult to complain about .
water damaged door and carpets repaired with tape .
gaming staff was nice .
i gave <UNK> a shot on three seperate occasions .
it went very well with the crust .
a good product will sell itself .
the gyro that they serve up is a <UNK> .
it is just plain and simply good and satisfying .
it was by no means a satisfying meal .
this all equates to a garbage product .
. i ' m right up the street .
this is my favorite sushi spot in phoenix .
you have to try these during your visit .
it is far too simple .
the <UNK> are deep fried and so damn flavorful .
charlie and eric make quite the team .
even a <UNK> knows that much .
cheers and good luck guys !
the mexicans really <UNK> us with the torta .
cheers and much luv !
do n't be a noob and do this .
for $ 0.00 , you ca n't beat it .
i ca n't recommend ron more highly .
excellent spot in great area !
my buddy seems ok with that .
good music , hipster crowd but fun .
<UNK> que tout est correct ?
y ' all phone number is disconnected .
not sure how that was possible but it is .
wait staff is not trained .
in the right hands it could work .
jeep sounded great when i got it back .
good and bad if you ask me .
good wings , sports on tv .
great variety , great coffee , fresh donuts .
check it out , you will be pleasantly suprised .
both are excellent and done right .
inside the mekong supermarket yes .
and all for only 00 bucks .
i do recommend what i know .
forget abt the earlier post abt their acceptable ramen .
order their spicy miso ramen there .
else it will be 0 star .
yes , great chorizo breakfast .
bad bad choice for sushi buffet .
now its just really bad .
great calzones , good pizza selections .
what is wrong with that previous paragraph ... microwave .
for the price , its definitely worth a visit .
can be crowded during lunch times .
the tortillas are home made and very <UNK> .
its very crowded and mostly first come first serve .
this would be <UNK> - 0 star .
and this is the dude that eats everything .
the location is a little hard to spot .
also check out their lunch sandwiches and burgers .
its very well balanced .
go there and fill yourself up for 00 bucks .
come on , thats a rip off .
two things they can work on .
get some cartel or something .
not a big deal really .
just do n't expect a beer .
the encore has great employees .
instead go to wicked spoon or gordon ramsey burger .
broccoli casserole best item on menu .
. try the jack mac !
great place to get soul food in the city .
the burrito was good but , the nachos sucked .
biz for 00 yrs .
and this a lawsuit waiting to happen .
the pizza is awesome .
took over 0 hours to get my room .
this casino is overrated and overpriced .
the food is fair .
the free breakfast was also exceptionally good .
price is easy on the wallet .
this restaurant is the bbq king in vegas .
the whole process could not have been better .
highly do n't recommend .
lack of staff training .
the <UNK> was also really bland and unappetizing .
first time visiting buddy ' s .
his advice : hash house a go go .
wait time : 0 mins .
i get the gyro with fries .
this appears to be own by a family .
we ' ve done sit down and take out .
plates range from about 00-00 on average .
not worth your time or your money .
let ' s avoid that .
there ' s no good smoked brisket in wisconsin .
the chorizo has great flavor .
everyone in my family enjoyed the selections i retrieved .
definitely worth a visit while in las vegas .
<UNK> with interesting folk .
yummy yogurt , nice 0 - cup french press .
<UNK> on rotation on the flatscreen !
neat retro <UNK> , new movies as well .
go check ' em out !
wo n't be disappointed .
the one employee there named david was on fire .
david is an asset !
the food was sublime .
everything was sub par .
these guys took care of us .
these guys have definitely earned my respect .
i ' ll keep my business elsewhere .
now i am here for my 0000 x0 .
no problems with my order either .
maybe the management is n't prepared to be management .
this place is terrible .
you are a joke .
you have to be the worst .
thanks pete for your great work .
you would be wise to avoid it .
this room was very challenging but definitely doable .
good knife and gun selections !
italian beef is the only thing i get there .
this is what a real taco shop should be .
pretty upset about that .
it ' s an ok meh , at best .
little bit pricey for what you get .
sausage is sparse in the sausage gravy .
he told me how the food will be prepared .
i highly recommend this place .
our ` ` go to ' ' chinese place .
it ' s one of our usual dinner joints .
great place and cheap too .
try the # 000 its the best ever .
lots of fat dudes and straight up losers .
next stop the big bosses or bbb !
what ' s the sense of having a host ?
backup staff & location knowledge equals <UNK> !
you wait 0/0 hour for no service .
you ca n't go wrong here just do it .
cool spot ill come back .
service was smooth with the assistant <UNK> .
i had a very tight window to move .
i recommend this hotel when your in las vegas .
that is open now .
hope they clear that strategy up asap .
nothing more to say .
this review is far overdue .
the ambiance is good .
they ' d get a zero if i could .
reasonable prices for the strip .
the overall experience here was just ok .
here ' s why : 0 .
better off going for a run outside .
the casino seemed run down and pretty empty there .
this place has a full bar .
not what you would expect for casual dining .
nice sized place for an event center .
never help out and the security is even worse .
watch out for your credit card as well .
worst management and service ever .
really good food with exceptional service as well .
this place was awesome .
unknown to me that new management had taken over .
wow i know what good pho tastes like now .
i would have walked miles .
one the places i enjoy going in town .
one thing i learned here is about <UNK> vodka .
very close to a lot of things .
they ' ve closed down .
everything fresh and fish taco out of this world .
maybe for a quick lunch or dinner .
the food is good for quick lunch or dinner .
the food is fairly good , not too bad .
the bento boxes were pretty good .
also the wings are good for late night .
if not , forget it .
overall , a good place to eat .
the other 0-0 star reviews here are very suspicious .
i ' ll be back .
what a bunch of douchebags .
do yourself a favor and run .
a fantastic experience all around .
sorry guys , you can do better .
great job and very professional .
such a cool place with great food !
the family that owns this place is nice .
the place just gets better .
chef , chris <UNK> is doing a terrific job .
the dining area was busy but not packed .
<UNK> , no real complaints about this shop .
bob did just that ! ! .
way to go bob ... job well done .
clay would have found it , if it existed .
brand new to scottsdale .
great burgers , shakes and pittsburg authentic food .
this is favorite sushi place in az . .
big daddy is a great place .
braised beef was amazing .
another modern resturant in las vegas .
subway will never be the same to me .
it all went down very well .
remember , it ' s performance art .
worth your 00 $ .
the luxor has done something tricky .
this was bad sign # 0 .
this was bad sign # 0 .
for you are already at the luxor .
nice , friendly atmosphere .
what a let down .
` ` hey , how you doin ' ?
in for music player hookup .
this place is ridiculous .
maybe toss a sign out there , guys .
professor <UNK> i presume ? ! no ?
where is the strip house ?
this is the place to get your noms on .
the staff here are awesome .
it ' s a pretty cool touch .
i also had the <UNK> beef which was fantastic .
this was not a problem here at all !
would recommend any and all to check them out .
my experience with henderson vape was a mixed bag .
came here passing by with my <UNK> wife .
this is complemented by a sizable selection of juices .
las vegas , you have a treasure .
this place should be front and center .
i very seldom give a 0 star rating .
the food is terrific .
i think the retro building looks great from outside .
this is all you need to know .
not worth the hype .
very middle of the road .
the jukebox was a little bit crap too .
i like this place .
they would kill it .
it ' s worth the trip .
one of the best sandwiches in town .
cheap , quality food .
i eat here three times a week .
plus they messed it up twice now .
a little heavy on the msg .
overpriced mess of a place overall .
never a dull moment .
this place used to be the sh * t .
i ca n't say anything bad about this spot .
with or without hookah this place holds up .
very run of the mill without being a disappointment .
too much like la food scene .
try the half lobster and noodle for 00 bucks .
the bartenders there are always entertaining .
one of the better spots at cosmo .
now this place is packed with the affliction set .
you ' ll thank me later .
this is what the internet is all about .
am i a bad person for this ?
best part is the music .
low quality all the way .
my only problem are the front desk people .
basically no one organized this bar .
look at the reviews .
i like this place .
not that great of a combo .
goddamn i love this joint .
do n't be a wimp .
the bad : completely lackadaisical staff .
good happy hour 0 to 0 everyday .
the <UNK> are a trip .
keep up the great work !
the beef skewers were phenomenal .
equipment is not maintained or stocked properly .
all you can eat was limited .
the plating was very nice !
the food is not even close to french .
it ' s a sad and <UNK> attempt .
i hope this place is around for a while .
i could care less about being separated .
ended up just getting a pepperoni calzone .
went here for a business lunch with customers .
the alligator was the bomb <UNK> .
i will be back again .
we noticed the awesome prices of beer too .
my only negative was the soggy greasy tater rounds .
best 0 bucks you will spend !
no phone call back ever .
the food was hot and very good .
not the standard chick-fil-a !
as good as it gets is right !
there is never no waits .
the food is amazing .
the fish and chip where good but nothing special .
i was blown away by the show .
do n't let the exterior fool you .
great service , cool atmosphere .
my royalty / loyalty card is in the <UNK> .
yep definitely not doing this again .
salsa bar is superb .
this was chance number 0 at the new location .
from the outside , paris las vegas looks fantastic .
it is very outdated and needs an epic upgrade .
no , it ' s a lot of smoke .
best gym i have ever been a part of .
the rooms are incredible .
feels like being at home and then some .
definitely a dance oriented soleil show .
there is no crowd interaction as well .
my only knock is overall value .
however , the place is in <UNK> .
the place is in dire need of <UNK> .
fantastic setup , good music and fun crowds .
the mood is alive and fast paced .
case in point , omnia nightclub .
it ' s part of the aria buildings .
the place is very clean .
there really is little to complain about .
great location and it was clean and well run .
breakfast buffet is average but satisfying .
i see no need to return here .
heck , even sonic manages to do that .
we ' ll make another facility choice next time .
the service was ok and the atmosphere was good .
my first time there i had the texas brisket .
good place for some decent mexican food .
i will say the service was excellent .
the <UNK> was especially refreshing i must say .
it is easy to get to the path .
very nice brunch spot .
the price is also quite good .
but i would n't let that hold you back .
the pizza is tasty .
the calamari is excellent .
this new place is amazing .
thank you for all you do for us .
lots of large flat screen tv sets .
was a great location and good food and staff .
loud and obnoxious with no respect for their neighbors .
a banana mixed drink with nutella and peanut butter .
miyagi-san all the way .
it reminded me a lot of a seinfeld episode .
what more could you want ?
excellent in all ways .
this is a good steak house .
so why only three stars ?
especially with their very high margin .
thanks arby ' s , i will be back .
now off on my 00 mile drive back home .
<UNK> overpriced for what amounts to very mediocre pizza .
picture <UNK> ' s quality .
$ 00 for guys to get in .
$ 00 grey goose / club sodas .
all i can say is wow .
a <UNK> 0 stars .
clearly a very disappointing visit to oregano ' s .
in summary very average .
the prices have gone up the quality is shameful .
excellent service and strongly recommended .
the <UNK> was a piece of art .
wow that is some rip off for sure .
interesting and a nice take on hot & sour .
while the food was average the service was excellent .
boring according to a 0 year old boy .
food took 0 hour to come .
not much of an impression .
their smores plate was not good either .
laid back music and great atmosphere .
screaming curse words and taking their shirts off .
there must be better places for seafood .
small place about 00 tables .
las vegas fresh fish was bad .
which resulted in poor service .
life is too short .
not sure why they did this .
wow , this place was a surprise .
the buffet at the wynn hotel <UNK> the rest .
do we need the characters <UNK> nonsense ?
imagine , ` ` where do you work ?
' ' ` ` oh really ?
what do you do ?
vegas isnt it time to look elsewhere ?
minimum 00-00 people per family .
a wonderful sushi bar .
also , dine somewhere else before getting here .
you mostly come here for the atmosphere .
a very nice selection of <UNK> dishes were available .
0/0 inside seating 0/0 outside under cover .
fair view of the quiet portion of the strip .
kinda small ... but great .
0 - rrb - braised beef tacos are excellent .
good job cpk las vegas !
it was very good with emphasis on italian naturally .
the in room internet is expensive but useful .
these are the size of most three bed homes .
the tower suites has its own elevators .
room service is great .
i had this removed from the bill .
<UNK> deli is nice for lunch and a beer .
overall steve wynn is the king of vegas .
in my opinion its only rival is palazzo .
once you go you will return for years .
00 ' ' lcd hdtv and iphone dock .
there is a strong focus on american wines .
mandalay bay is one of our favorite hotels .
no complaints - nor any great <UNK> .
reasonable prices for vegas .
nice people running the place .
00 minutes for breakfast , 00 min at 00pm .
food aside , this is hard to stomach .
overall , this hotel is very good .
i <UNK> with the thermostat , but no dice .
definitely suggest all to visit and see for yourself .
even my buddy that recommended the place felt embarrassed .
fair prices and nice friendly personnel .
frites were very good .
' ' guess who we gave our business to ?
well , for several reasons .
the history of the location trumps the transition .
the shakes were outstanding .
you can do without those .
in any case , it was a great meal .
had dinner with my gf couple nights ago .
the place itself looks very nice and elegant .
he definitely exaggerated the size by at least double .
novelty at its finest .
he asked for extra <UNK> on the meal .
but none of them were as good as mikes .
keep up the great work mike .
seems to have a pretty good following .
quality and service are excellent .
but quality was outstanding .
i will be coming back .

look forward to coming here for shows .
a very confusing process when ordering food .
wait staff is prompt and courteous .
the pho is good .
the <UNK> were good .
this place is consistently fantastic .
the biggest problem here is the lighting .
beer list is solid but not mind-blowing .
check in was pleasant as well .
overall they earn a solid 0 .
the cheap nights are cool .
concessions are over priced .
i ' ll be back for sure .
that ' s right folks i went there !
they do n't make you feel like an outsider .
five guys sticks to the basics .
but <UNK> it taste so good .
give it a shot you want be disappointed .
you got ta try this place .
a giant mobile video game van .

0 stars for the folks at insert coins .
food was ... interesting .
they did a fairly solid job .
showed up and measured then dropped the price .
went through the drive thru after football practice .
that way everything stays upright and in order .
not a lot of fat like other local markets .
by a bit i ' m talking 00 minutes .
my only real complaint is the inflated prices .
no lines , great food , and reasonable price .
p ! <UNK> put on an amazing performance .
something about standing up during one of the songs .
the food vendors did an amazing job .
i would rate snaps at about 0.0 .

the environment is friendly and easy on the eyes .
now to end on a positive note .
the rolled tacos are a solid chose as well .

the staff here seems very professional and compassionate .
if nothing else it is <UNK> worth a try .

if ping pong is your poison they have that .
00x better then the one on eastern .
they operate in a bit of a circuit .
a few minutes at each station then they rotate .
flips and jumps and bars all over the place .
its a giant playground for the athletic young .
they even have an oven remade by <UNK> restoration .
service is kinda slow .
drinks were pretty solid when they finally arrived .
this is an easy 0 star review .
the carne asada nachos are still my personal favorite .
hybrid performance is more then just a gym .
no joke , as easy five stars .

what more can you ask for .
home depot is for the hardcore home improvement dude .
this is a yelp award winning install .
the catfish is fried to perfection .
that ' s right this guy .
the artisan flatbread pizza is super tasty .

pros : - very modern settings .
the beer selection was varied and exceptionally tasty .
i will definitely be making a return visit .
the mgm really seems to be a mixed bag .
- everything associated with the hotel is overpriced .
called mgm about it and was transferred to security .
i enjoy this chain .
the setting team is good and continue to improve .
motorcycles , cars , etc . .
and my house is within their <UNK> delivery area !
going to miss this place when i move .

service was even worse .
it would have made more sense for three baskets ?
brunch : wow this was epic .
the no chi was potato tots .
david is the master , there is none better .

they are phenomenal and work fast paced .
he also never let me run down on coals .
since he left , the hookah service sucks .
great staff , affordable pricing !
the laveen home depot is the best .
i go back and forth on this place .
overall a very enjoyable experience .
even after requesting service .
the service was unobtrusive and fine .
is that alright , sir ?
it is attractive and comfortable .
the chicken egg roll was not hot .
the pad thai had very little chicken .
the pad thai had very little chicken .
among them are perception of food and difficulties <UNK> .
that is the purpose of such sites .
if i do , i will deserve my fate .
the prices are generally excellent .
that was not acceptable to me .
this is an outstanding restaurant in most respects .
the latest visit was much better .
it is bogus pricing .
i hope the place will survive .
the pizza arrived 00 minutes after ordering it .

. and as they say .
. there are better ones in the valley .

this is the best breakfast place in scottsdale .
nevertheless , the service is truly great here .
i was really amazed by the bbq here .
i ' m from the south chicago .
therefore , i know what good bbq is .
great service and atmosphere .
overpriced in comparison to chinatown sf .
we expected all-you-can-eat dim sum .
everyone had lobster & crab noting both were exceptional .
this is the most stellar restaurant in charlotte .
. even starbucks closed here .
. they are here to stay .
the next level of dissatisfaction came when we paid .
. this place has got it all .
they were cooked to perfection and accompanied with chimichurri .
. you will not be disappointed .
the <UNK> was great as well !
the manager is useless .
very pleasant to deal with .
long line and understaffed .
they will rip you off left and right .
customer service is an abomination !
that will help your business grow .
. this is a good subway .
the staff was friendly and the place was clean .
bbq pork sandwich is very good portions are monstrous .
one of the best sushi restaurants in vegas .
not bad for vegas .
terrible communication and chain of command .
house <UNK> well above the needed amount .

the deep dish pizza is really amazing .
friendly wait staff , great atmosphere , great food .
great locals discount also .
get the appetizer sampler .
` ` cozy ' ' aka cramped environment inside .
they were good but nothing special for $ 00 .
the caniac combo is perfect for two .
go to target and never look back .
and they know me by name .
cool vibe , friendly staff , chill atmosphere .
guess they have a captive audience .
it ' s a rough ride but fun nonetheless .
we have eaten here probably 00 times .
the food was average at best .
like the use of video alot .
ate here twice on a recent business trip .
piss poor managment is all i can say .
they sent pedro who seemed very knowledgeable and professional .
this location is a scam .
you only find these tactics in third world country .
be careful with this location .
what kind of mickey mouse operation is this ?
that ' s about it .
- rrb - and our internet fees .
the food is fantastic and the atmosphere is better .
the trifecta seasoning is the way to go .
this one blew me away .
you can tell someone cares about quality .
scored some points in the creativity department .
the service is slow for a reason .
having brunch here is great also .
tony , does the same .
that is hard to find these days .
no points , no traffic school .
i ' ll be back again .
so plus twenty points .
though be warned there will be arrogant jerks .
tons of clubs and interesting things .
so consider my 0 stars as per other subways .
nowhere near as good food as paris .
have you seen the south park episode entitled <UNK> ?
renaissance las vegas hotel ?
0/0 mile from the strip ?
the hotel was clean and 000 % smoke free .
would i stay at renaissance again ?
does n't get much better than that .
value for the dollar .
did i say quantity ?
the american dream , folks .
it ' s an a-ok review .
the menu was standard fare .
gf asked me for a <UNK> take on it .
got the miso burger and oxtail chili cheese fries .
beer prices are decent too .
it was served with mayonnaise .
this was an absolute mistake .
the dealers are attractive .
screw you , roulette .
all sandwiches are $ 0 before tax .
this made it easier to adventure and explore .
0 of 0 tires not even cleaned .
love this local vegas hangout .

i had my brothers car done today .
the car selections they provide me are usually good .
keep up the good work hertz !

<UNK> is the best of the best .
the dining area is a pig <UNK> .
can <UNK> is a must .
shop at your own risk .

the buffalo chicken pizza was decent but very greasy .
this place is great .
great place to take kids .
the staff was excellent and made great recommendations .
i will be back for sure .
the food was fresh .
my gyro was filled to the brim with chicken .
that does n't even make sense .
the man looked pretty upset and just walked away .
this place is amazing .
you wo n't go wrong .
small place with good service .
this place is worth a visit .
the details of the place really impressed me .
... simply the best .
you can afford this .
oh just 0 tiny reasons .
the new space is awesome inside .
it ' s very nice and well appointed .
well deserved 0/0 stars !
recommend this place highly .
amazed a nice room could be so cheap .
this place is very new .
the place never really reached its full potential .
the place was very clean and looked nice .
overall people should check this place out .
the service was kind of bad .
go to the silver sevens .
the worst was the calamari .
great buffet at an extremely reasonable price .
it beats paying 00 for an underwhelming buffet .
serving staff appeared and disappeared .
there are better options .
absolutely outstanding and unusual food .
the yard looks great and clean .
the concept is pretty cool actually .
next came the main courses .
next came some chicken skewers .
our waiter , alex was fantastic .
a spicy chili sauce coated the six meaty wings .
definitely a wing to write home about .
aloha specialties delivers on so many levels .
next day the check engine light switches on .
$ 000 dollar fix .
there was lots , but quality did not suffer .
very unprofessional , unorganized , and zero communication skills .
would not recommend this credit card to anyone .
now the best car rental alternative in phoenix .
0 stars for these guys .
i left feeling very informed and satisfied .
temptation is around every corner at this airport !
well , at least not walking distance .
but , the dining area was packed .
but that was n't the case .
this place knows carb control .
the chicken katsu loco moco .
the staff here were very helpful and attentive .
earl of sandwich had a location in the palms !
it was still hot .
both blue and red teams have failed miserably !
alcohol enthusiast will get this .
after spending some time here , i felt accomplished .
a failed mission is now a victory !
the room was nicely prepared upon our walk-in .
too bad my phone battery died .
typical for a well known ramen spot .
the presentation was nicely put together .
i left full , <UNK> , and unsatisfied .
these guys always perform with heart .
breakfast , lunch , and dinner .
the assorted sushi were fresh and enjoyable .
the seating was quick and complimented friendly service .
i kept my word for getting my monies worth !
a great sized piece to satisfy a drunken appetite .
still a great deal than a cab .
the drivers i had were great and friendly .
i most definitely would recommend super shuttle las vegas .
the menu was full of delicious fusion tapas dishes .
picking menu items was like picking lottery numbers .
our party consisted of seven guys .
last year i only experienced the theater .
this is my first experience with five guys burgers .
the line was moving at a decent rate .
you can see grease soak through the paper bag .
better yet i ' ll throw a bbq !
so check in here was fairly quick .
it was an ok hotel .
the hotel staff was fairly accommodating .
first , the waitstaff at this place are incredible .
their beers are meh but food was good .
decent spot in downtown though .
at least they had stone on tap .
decent beer but the service is n't very good .
easy 0 star place .
this place is top notch .
great service and subs .
go mikes way on the subs !
pulled pork sandwich was dry .
nothing to complain about here .
i just had a great experience at c0 .
i will be back for sure .
service is consistently very good too !
- rrb - overall very disappointed .
the place stinks too .
the staff was friendly and very helpful .
this place is really awesome .
it earns my highest recommendation !
the rice itself was adequate , but nothing more .
it should have been replaced probably years ago .
happy hour from 0pm to 0pm .
what more can you ask for ?
here ' s a brief summary of each visit .
it was a great meal .
it ' s the bomb .
first looks : red .
<UNK> orders a manhattan .
points for having choice of alcohol .
unfortunately <UNK> ' s drink is stronger than preferred .
the bartender has a heavy pour .
all in all it was a nice visit .
forget the gym membership .
now that ' s time efficient .
i definately recommend texas land & cattle .
first impression : truck stop ?
where is the gasoline smell ?
went with a <UNK> for lunch not long ago .
lunch was ok , burgers are n't bad .
i ' ll be right back .
as most folks do , i enjoy their coffee .
plus , it overpriced for what it was .
plus , it was overpriced for what it was .
the sampler platter is huge .
price is very fair for the area .
a few more fixes and another star .
these guys do not get it .
excuse me , what happened to the other side ?
mediocre execution on everything else .
then got to sample some of their exceptional brew .
just poor poor service at this place .
i have to complain about a new sharing policy .
what kind of policy is this ?
what else could you want ?
the back seats were $ 00 .
the pizza served is just ok , nothing special .

these guys are great !
fyi they travel all over the valley .
this place is fantastic .
that and a bowl of rice hits the spot .
meal prices ranged from $ 00 to $ 00 .
where else could you find affordable and quality food ?
arguing employees behind the counter .
screwing up customer orders and not taking accountability .
what an incredible find .
awesome <UNK> and chorizo and eggs .
i would recommend apex .
my chrysler 000 looks great !
dive casino and basic cafe .
never again will i go there .
he puts on a one heck of a show .
ask for the choo choo special .
this is probably my favorite place to eat .
did n't realize what it was .
the only disappointment was the tonkotsu ramen .
the broth needs some work .
the place was super clean best indian restaurant .
great ambiance to straight chillin with da homies .
the pools are always clean and well maintained .
but seriously , this place is great .
our company received awesome service from superior cleaning equipment .
good spot with good vibes !
brisket , pulled pork outstanding .
this is a common problem with bbq beans .
same with the gravy .
this is no place to cut corners .

yelp makes me give at least one star .
i leave the bike .
<UNK> is a must go dining spot in vegas .
stay away from arrowhead and gary
a <UNK> guy brought me my order .
this place is awesome ! ! .

need to expand their locations .
went to the one in d terminal .

what a great restaurant .
very nice atmosphere with very friendly and fun staff .
one final note about there handling a birthdays .
one more thing ... try the casablanca lager .
the employees were friendly and engaging .
i got the steak bomb and was very pleased .
the sandwich is similar to a philly cheese steak .
my first restuarant i <UNK> while in madison .
worth a trip if you are in las vegas .
had the linguini and clams tonight .
i mean it was good and all .
other than that it was a pretty cool place .
would i run there again next weekend ?
service was spot on .
working on desert now .
never had a bad time here .
service is always great .
so i went there for lunch .
i stepped up and placed my order .
total bill $ 0.00 .
- lrb - remember my change was 00 cents .
one star and another lost customer .
will i go there again ?
settle up with the cashier on your way out .
call it four and a half .
very good and fresh tuna .
yeah , it was fantastic .
how am i the first to review <UNK> ?
our service was very good as well .
seating is indoors or outdoors .
they have a bunch of heaters outside .
this is the <UNK> champ of our culinary tour .
it was succulent and just fell off the bone .
a great meal in a nice setting .
call it three and a half .
this was some damn good pizza .
the pizza was great and the crust was fantastic .
the view , service and presentations were all impeccable .
as i said , the food was excellent .
<UNK> was fantastic as well .
nearly four <UNK> of history for you here .
something for everyone here .
the city started here in 0000 .
how cool is that ?
restaurants and golf were stellar as well .
another four seasons gem .
they had a nice brick oven which seemed promising .
however it came in reverse order .
a waste of 00 dollars .
this was a pathetic piece of crap .
i would expect this from the vending machine .
same old tired wait staff .
but that ' s where the new ended .
the use of the elevators perhaps ?
your money is best spent elsewhere .
interesting , but it does n't quite gel .
the people who run the place are trying .
the food was average .
my wife ordered a big <UNK> burro .
mexican food and air supply just do n't mix .
it would be an excellent choice for entertaining out-of-towners .
what a difference a day makes .
it would make things much more orderly .
they act as if they actually like their jobs .
i also order a large fountain drink .
let ' s say it was interesting .
over the lunch hour , it is loud .
part of it is the pei wei <UNK> .
and that ' s not bad .
it was an excellent experience .
boy , did they have quite the selection .
every size and shape of saguaro you can imagine .
some were around 00 feet .
some had arms and <UNK> .

the lunch prices are quite reasonable .
what could have been better ?
hope nobody else does either .
cold food health risk .
this place did not <UNK> .
mike and his team is great !
the <UNK> pork slice , however , was horrendous .
needless to say i left a sub-par tip .
time to find a new home in chandler .

the place was just as i expected .
all the rooms that were comped were very nice .
the casino is very comfortable .
casino is nice but not much luck here .
just the beef bowl .

one of the better steak houses in vegas .
if seafood is your thing this is the place .

denise , mike and benjamin were awesome .
largest rolls i have found at any sushi restaurant .
huge humidor and a large selection .
to it ' s taste .
all in all a boring , low rent calzone .
not bad , just boring .
not all bad but less than ok overall .
too bad since the crust still looked promising .
- hot and sour seafood soup .
nice place , lousy pizza .
low , long and simple .
decor : austin powers meets ol ' charlotte .
ok it ' s kind of funny .
what was left was less than 0/0 pound .
then i think about the texas roadhouse .
$ 00 including the hot tea .
not too cheap considering .
sounds harsh , not my fault .
the presentation was nice but nothing else was .
0 stars for the ny style pizza .
- salsa and chips .
. with tangy bbq sauce ?
yes , compared to other big cities .
- not enough direct flights in or out .
three and a half stars .

not even ray ' s pizza * was crisp .
we started by splitting a garlic mussel appetizer .
as first impressions go this one really sucked .
i ate , paid and left .
service was somewhat <UNK> but no biggie .
' ' - a real class act .
that may help explain it .
caveat under new ownership .
the marinade was truly excellent .
ok that ' s the new address now .
still mild but at least they were real .
prices are not cheap , between average and high .
at <UNK> <UNK> the bar is set really low .
three of us had lunch there a while back .
matthews is a foodies hell .
based on my limited experience .
now offer more choices as a side .
it ' s not even worth mentioning it .
three and a half stars .

like i said awkward .
hopefully they deliver or do take out .
sweet dreams old man .
lots of good stuff in the <UNK> as well .

three and a half stars .
that ' s it for the good .
service was absolutely dismal for no good reason .
it was <UNK> undercooked but very good .
the <UNK> sauce was home made and fresh .
unless i find an argentine butcher .
it was <UNK> yet more tender .
normal for miami but high for independence blvd . .
did n't offer to comp anything .
the <UNK> said no problem .
the new and improved menu is sub par .
believe it or not for once the name fits .
- the baba ganoush good but not great .
smoked chicken wings and newcastle brown it is .
a blade runner experience all the way .
fun , cheap not recommended for the hygiene <UNK> .
note : closed on mondays 0.0 stars .
is this place under new management ?
no more sirloin cooked in jim bean sauce ... .
where should i start ... .
the executive chef came out and met me .
the <UNK> was better but still undercooked .
the place is great , the service is great .
wednesday special awsome fried chicken w / 0 sides .
my wife asked if it was fried spam .
there was not enough spinach in it to notice .
the pricing is generally moderate but inconsistent .
small place but it does n't feel cramped .
i never asked for his opinion , did i ?
he was as arrogant as he was ignorant .
thanks for nothing folks three and a half .
boy that cleared my sinuses lol !
very very good but short of excellent .
the spring roll was <UNK> .
- rrb - printed on it without mentioning this .
aside from that it was i said great .
- duck curry , good but no cigar .
age does not always equate with wisdom .
nearly ready for prime time .
still , very nice for a side .
where ' s <UNK> when we need them ?
i like charcoal but here it overpowered the seafood .
not bad , not great , not cheap .
three and 0/0 stars .
meanwhile the place is at least 0/0 empty .
what a nice gesture .
decent run of the mill airport .
paul <UNK> is an outstanding mortgage consultant .
great late night option .

cool staff , clean place .
avoid the steele creek location if you can .
minus 0 for no one understanding english .
not much can be expected .
it was a street fair .
overall a great time was had .
never enough cashiers work .

generous portions , friendly counter guy .
i hope they expand to nc also .
pizza was pretty good .
so did the <UNK> .
now for the bad : horrible water quality .
seafood was not very good .
the menu for this place is very diverse .
for what it is , it ' s fantastic .
i work down the road from here at <UNK> .
0â 0/0 stars review .
casual dining inside an old school type of casino .
inexpensive hotel with poor customer service .
honestly , ti was cheap rooms .
one positive : the location .
tile and grout looked brand new afterwards .
this place is amazeballs .
spoke with the owner .
gotham bagels are excellent .
why is this place soooooo bad yet stays alive .
a must go destination for anyone visiting vegas .
huge ... lot ' s of action !
this is not necessarily a bad thing ... .
this is french bistro dining .
i have never seen cask beer served , ever .
the rooms are gorgeous and the staff is great .
what a great hotel / casino !
in no way do you feel lost or trapped .
look up their reviews on yelp .
the service was very friendly but extremely slow .
located inside the californian hotel in downtown .
free parking in the garage .
this was an exceptional experience in every <UNK> way .
booking the reservation online was easy and straight forward .
the staff was extremely helpful and courteous .
` ` 00 minutes ' ' was his reply .
very nice place to go .
its a local , regular patrons only dive bar .
just my advice and overall feedback .
jeff is the man .
jeff is very skilled and highly recommended !
just had delivery from <UNK> d ' s .
and special requests are filled , without a problem .
pizza is always hot , wings always fresh .
no evidence of anything was left behind .
valet seems like the more obvious to me .
right out of german town , philly .
i ' m a <UNK> .
upper management promised to review and report .
avoid the flamingo hotel .
<UNK> to cars filthy condition .
since their recent remodel this place is the pits !
may as well shop at walmart ... .
same level of service for less money !
this place was mediocre at best .
service was good from host stand to our server .
numerous passengers missed their ongoing flights .
friendly and knowledgeable staff .
the food is fantastic .
will definitely stop by again .
definitely worth the exploration and a return visit .
here are some suggestions for this establishment .
have staff wear clean uniforms .
get it together t . c . s !
live music is great .
this place sucks especially the white manager guy .
the calamari was ok , nothing tremendous but solid .
all were fantastic and the service is great .
then had an issue with a fuel <UNK> failing .
the food here is great , amazing breakfast .
only thing wrong is picking up an order .
i have no negative comments about this place .
ordered some shrimp and the 0.0 lbs lobster .
moderate prices for moderate sushi .
really give it 0.0 stars .
in town for work .
not sure what the fuss is about either way .
i think a <UNK> ipa was $ 00 .
i highly recommend <UNK> to anyone .
francis , the gm , was friendly and funny .
ivan and florence have an outstanding track record .
the room was very nice .
roll up shades produced a great view of vegas .
great price for it , if you ask me .
it is like a freaking wind tunnel .
friendly atmosphere but not pushy .
a 0st class operation .
i guess the uber app does not have gps ?
really had practice uber taking advantage of drunk people .
it ' s really nondescript .
as others have mentioned , these are small tacos .
worth the 0 dollars i paid ?
twenty minutes later there ' s still no engineer .
this tells me two things .
room 0 : i am relocated tom room 000 .
the rest of my stay is uneventful .
this hotel has significant issues to rectify .
great atmosphere for dine in also
also , to boot , they charged my card .
they will take good care of you .
the only downer is its location .
bartender was fantastic and very accommodating .
so , the chow .
ostrich - very lean , and decent .
mashed sweet taters - very good .
<UNK> with spicy peanut sauce .
0.0 rounded up to 0 for ok .
all of that , egg works .
what ' s that you ask ?
but , am i satisfied with all that ?
lower cost of operation means lower food price .
you can not go wrong with hk seafood garden .
$ 0.00 who could beat that ?
this is the fitness center inside the cosmopolitan hotel .
one : their hot drinks are great .
they have some great gyros for great prices .
light on atmosphere , serious about service .
they are extremely enthusiastic about their beer and business .
friendly fast and knowledgeable service .
attractive wooden butcher block tables and window views .
sadly wiener world does it worst .
the real reason to go is the outdoor patio .
boring , unhealthy , and coma inducing .
the <UNK> answer is without question , burgatory !
why not give <UNK> the full fiver ?
there ' s 0 things a buffet can offer .
so they have quantity , but <UNK> the quality ?
it completely lived up to the hype .
premium pizza has a <UNK> price .
it is a combination cuban and chinese food restaurant .
why not a 0 ?
franktuary has huge potential .
potato and lentil pumpkin squash curry .
nu brings a fresh twist to old classics .
notion is such a place .
0 is how many tacos i ate .
the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable .
you are seated promptly even on busy nights .
an incredibly inventive <UNK> japanese tapas fusion menu .
great place not to go for anything else .
the raw brick interior is stark but attractive .
it is n't closed .
there are fish tacos .
this place combines the best of both worlds .
all of that was enjoyable .
this place was opened by one of their chefs .
the wait staff is extraordinarily fast and attentive .
the brussel sprouts were good , but not great .
most high end steak houses are heavy on pretension .
the rumors are true .
we all accept that life is about trade offs .
you can smoke , but you might get <UNK> .
only a donkey would not love el burro !
very standard , nothing particularly bad or good .
so why my low score ?
so what ' s bad ?
<UNK> is a cozy italian restaurant .
one of the best asian restaurants in pittsburgh !
the union grill is a notable exception .
the ambiance and atmosphere are tops .
friendly staff and good background music .
t & k ' s is no exception .
there is a lot of hype about cure .
they have a great whiskey selection and killer burgers .
great sushi , huge portions and diverse menu .
do yourself a favor , do not stay here .
yah ... one of those situations .
the western lake beef soup was great .

very good brisket and pulled pork .
i should have upgraded or checked out right then .
the wallpaper was tearing .
where in the heck was the <UNK> ?
where are the <UNK> ?
the customer service is abysmal .
asked for check ... took another 00 minutes .
after several tries and long time waits .
the only service that worked well was the valet .
try the hot and sour soup and <UNK> chicken .
the food at these places is 00 times better .
nice place , great service .
note this was on a thursday night .
the government has <UNK> in what it considers <UNK> .
the service is great .
this place lives up to its hype .
. this place is not all that great .
its actually not even good .
i had a pint of dos equis lager .
what happened to me today is a game changer !
got to big to control quality .
waited a good 00 minutes and never got helped .
do n't bother going here .
people do n't seem to matter .
it was covered in stains .
definitely give these guys a shot .
place was not good .
wo n't be coming back here .
the beer and most of the food is great .
this pizza is not a winner .
decent food and atmosphere .
even machines that work could use maintenance .
the manager / owner is very friendly .
the place was pretty busy .
it is for your own good .
keep up the genuine personality victor .
we noticed it only came with three courses .
it ' s f * * * ing amazing .
throw it on top of your kobe burger .
throw it on top of your buffalo burger .
you like lobster and shrimp ?
anyway , give it a shot .
i was n't even paying attention quite honestly .
just tried the gumbo here at southern rail .
ahead of the curve !

a hidden gem of a pizzeria in tempe .
one of my favorite spots in the phoenix area .
0 <UNK> for this place .
first class team at san tan vw .
the food is great .
lux is a perfect morning stop .
how pizza bianco is not 0 star amazes me .
nothing but good things to say about it .
it could be improved by warming .
what more can you say ?
<UNK> and <UNK> ingredients would have helped .
baba <UNK> : too much lemon .
the sandwiches can be more .
the yelp data needs correction .
this is not a $ $ restaurant .
this is at lease a $ $ $ .
i had to pay for parking .
the security line is a joke .
you get the full pat down .
they also had some very tasty <UNK> .
- rrb - great spot for archery .
big , wide open ranged dedicated for archery .
i went there for team trivia .
otherwise i would not have heard of <UNK> .
the only hot sauce available was tabasco .
in hindsight , i totally disagree with his advice .
there was an outdoor section that overlooked the <UNK> .
i used this place about 00 years ago .
for a service industry this seems insufficient .
five guys is good .
this is a burger joint .
i usually found what i needed .
the prices were competitive and the employees were helpful .
` <UNK> ' s food was ok .
this place is bomb .
what separates this thai from others is their seasonings .
that ' s about it .
the bill was $ 00 plus tax .
this happened at 0 locations .

the coffee is outstanding .
the coffee is outstanding .
view from the top gets even better .
this place is for anyone loves outdoors .
not to mention the sauna and steam room .
just say no to this place .
paid over $ 000 to get out this place .
just avoid this place .
one star rating out of principle .
excellent selection for its size .
fourth time there , first time for sunday brunch .
maybe the beer just ruined my taste buds .
hopefully they figure things out .
first time was soon after they opened .
good beer selection , but very poor value .
fish and chips were ok quality .
not super bang for buck but very fair prices .
hash browns & pancake were 00 ' s !
everything else was very good .
great service this morning .
anyways this story ends good .
never ordering from these guys again .
the order of medium boneless wings were probably frozen .

the service was quick and friendly .
<UNK> not what you expect .

so what does this show offer ?
fast checkin and housekeeping was good .
i thought the overall selection was outstanding !

this place was amazing .
not even a pub .
they only cost # 0 and last 00 minutes .
the seafood , especially the king crab was good .
the prime rib carvery was good too .
the service at the wynn buffet was excellent .
drinks were refilled quickly and empty plates cleared .
bbq beef was tough and lacked flavor .
that was a huge drop off from mesa grill .
the beers are good .
not even worth the star .
the service people are generally nice .
what more can you ask for ?
will be back when i return to vegas .
best patio in scottsdale hands down .
this is just an all-around good restaurant .
is there a better buffet in las vegas ?
delicious tacos , especially the tacos de adobada .
pizza was the best thing there .
oj was n't great .
go across the street to the palazzo or venetian .
it is right across from the concierge desk .
been here the last 0 days for lunch .
the caesar was excellent and was dressed perfectly .
excellent facilities with friendly staff and vets .
you could go to a specialist vet too .
what else can we ask ?
they need another machine or two .
my one complaint is their overly complicated checkout process .
i stumbled across this place by accident .
this place is excellent .
the location is excellent .
close to the bigger , fancier places .
cheaper than the big casinos 0 .
free parking attached to the hotel 0 .

excellent , friendly , attentive service .
the veal parmigiana was unbelievable .

the bbq sauce was sweet and tangy .

tasty bbq and sides , reasonable prices .
seems like honest home cookin ' .
the appetizer platter for 0 is a great value .

how can this happen ... twice ?
a welcome oasis in las vegas .
i particularly liked their fat bastard .

oh well , i hear joe beef is good .
it was as it should be , and more .
guacamole was poor and obviously from a can .
i would expect more .
<UNK> faster you bring them the more i have .

0 stop turned into 0 over the week .
try the fish & chips .
order a black & tan and fish and chips .
` ` that ` ` s good mon . .
this is definitely a second or third tiered university .
the atmosphere is an industrial feel , but welcoming .
the people all have a great attitude .
better its predecessor uncle bear ' s , though .

the staff is professional and very friendly .
try this place , if you dare .

' ' surrender is a world class club .
everyone that comes in is impressed .
there is a big outdoor pool area .
i went there four nights .
even on a wednesday , the club was full .
the club is rather tame .
a guy jumped into the swimming pool .
the bouncers were immediately there to fish him out .
it ' s very sanitized las vegas wild .
it was mostly people standing around .
now , 0 stars makes one think fancy .
the evil trick that got me here is priceline .
behind the hotel are two strip clubs .
