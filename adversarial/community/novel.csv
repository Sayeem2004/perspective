Why sunny is taller than nephis? İs he usin shadow manifestion?
Foreal. I wish they would ban it here like many other subs already have. I probably have a good 30 users from this sub alone blocked for sharing AI crap. Had one dude yesterday pretend like he actually worked to "make" a piece. My guy you clicked a button after feeding a machine some prompts. You essentially ordered a manufactured product. Not made art
Is this yours? Srsly man/woman/mer/elf/eldritch whatever you are, this is awesome.
''holy fuck" was my exact reaction to seeing that
Great art I don't want to take away from that but why does every single fan artist on this sub never draw neph taller than sunny
Sussie had amazing potential compared to sunphis. But now that sunphis has already sailed its not longer possible 😔
Speak your shi my brother everyone knows in their hearts you are right
Spit your shit brother. That's what I felt too when I was reading. Cassie and Sunny's bonds and conflicts with each other is just too delicious.
I could never support Cassie after everything she did. She is just untrustworthy. Someone who hides things from you, even if it is supposed to be good is decieving you. You can't be with a person you can't trust.
We are not sunny, we are readers. We are less bound to the irrationality of emotion. He's spent a decade with her, we have not. Hence why he 'trusts' her. While i don't hate cassie anymore, since she did all she could to redeem herself, it doesn't change the fact that sunny is still suffering the consequences of cassie and neph's selfish actions to this day. Not to mention all she could wasn't even all for sunny, it was mostly for herself. To create a weapon against fate and stop seeing visions.
Couldn't agree any fucking less 🔥🔥🔥
Why would we kill you when all you did was spitin FACTS
Sometimes, being scared but prepared can save your ass from future onslaught 😔
I'm sorry bro, your tastes are too GOD for this world, we're not prepared, I'm afraid I'll have to silence you
He didn't make her, he killed her and took her shadow.
Would it? Technically she isn't a corpse, it's her soul. Does that still count? He would essentially be banging a ghost with a tangible body.
Depends? Do you think that fucking the FNAF animatronics is necrophilia?
You can infer what im trynna say but she's the only woman who keeps her mouth shut throughout all the ups and downs. Ofcourse she is best girl
Bro you alone have made something which 7KA could not do it properly. Stand proud, hope you will become big name in this industry. Get better everyday man. God bless.
“Because changing Star asked me to show mercy today” while he had weavers mask on, meaning that Nephis told him to “Show no mercy”
They fucked for 3 days straight, but you have to read 1000 more chapters to reach that point.
God asked me to kill you. In this instance, you know that I'm lying. But surely you don't think God asked me to spare you. You would think, "God didn't ask him anything at all." This is all just cringey speculation by some freaky readers, I'm not sure why anyone is taking it seriously
Seriously? This fanbase is fucking weird. Like that is not what that meant at all. How was that even interpreted as such? That's not how the mask or lies work.
“Moon” and “windy” or some dumb sht
I bet he give some weird shit name to his child 😂. Nephis will argue with him for a week about the name.
I completely forgot about the fact that sunny has lived well over a hundred lives already 😭 damn.
Elyas, ananke, noctis, windflower, Cassie, kai and effie probably
Don't forget obel and julius. ( a d probably some of the names his kids had in his battle against nightmare, heck maybe even the name of the heart chain as she was his mother there )
Nah nephis got cucked while she was struggling to survive the dreamrealm 💀💀💀
The chain lord who had the lineage of heart god , in the second nightmare sunny was in while fighting nightmare he was in the role of the chain lord son .where he watched solvane kill her and burn her whole island to the ground. And the nightmare ended by him burning alive while holding his mother corpse.
Nothing meaningful, nothing that’d bring a tear to your eye, and absolutely not shit like “Albus Severus.”
Sunny definitely takes after his mom. If it's snowing when his kid is born you best believe that kids name is gonna be 'snowfall' or something like that.
He wasn't that buff , he's described as lean alot , and his horns are alot longer than that to be able to gore enemies with , other than that it's pretty good.
For me, it's like lifestealer from dota but with more hands and pitch black carapace.
Huh, way more buff than what I had in mind, I always had a more slender picture in mind.
The one thing missing is the sword-like protrusions from his body.
Man Mordret was so good during his arc. Sucks he's mid now
It's from a game named "I have no mouth and I must scream" there is also a 11 pages novel about it
I'm going to say the craziest, most irrational thing anyone has ever said (I think) and I'll probably get everyone's hate. But I like the ship: 🖤SunnyxCassie and SunnyxMorgan🖤
When we see Jet the first time. Definitely the "hardest" part in volume one according to sunny
If we get a sweeping shot of the forgotten shore from the top of the statue right when the sun comes up for the first time that would look sick
As Sunny cannot be seen in public anymore the 'Eye Candy' title would be given to June.
Um actually, Cassie's feat of getting Sunny to break fate wouldn't count as her act of defience as it happend when she was a master
Well…. That snake has to transform in the real one …. I can’t see how a baby snake would be useful
Well considering how serpent has to change its size based on what weapon sunny chooses to turn it into I assume the marks can do the same
It would be really funny if the image had Cassie looking the wrong way cause she’s blind.
Did you think this was femme sunny, Nephis and Cassie? If so that’s incredibly hilarious but also plausible to believe if you hadn’t read the latest chapter.
Cassie with her hands over her face while violent thumping noises happen above her for the 168th hour straight.
Ah yes The only Rival of Extraordinary Rock but Esteemed Sire Extraordinary rock is stronger.
Now draw Morgan riding Kai. (When he’s a dragon of course)
Draw a movie poster of The Devil Of antartica but instead of sunny it's the Extraordinary rock as the hero
Words cannot describe how beautiful, magnificent, divine this artwork is. I will hang it on my wall and stare at it for hours on end, praising the perfection that is the Extraordinary Rock. (Unironically though that is a very nice looking rock)
This mf Sunny has an army of literal THOUSANDS of GREAT creatures who the fuck are they going to be fighting that's going to need both Sunny and Neph 😭😭😭
Fifth Nightmare they gonna be put in the body of the 2014 bobcats playing against prime lebron or something because WHO is Sunny's next extreme diff crash out against, goku?
Isn't it the dreamspawn sovereign? I think he was called Aesterion or close to that name. Sorry for the inaccuracy, I'm currently at the 3rd Nightmare.
Sacred/cursed level enemies and above. Asterion, skinwalker, whatever’s on the moon.
She isn’t evil but she definitely isn’t a good person. The entire cohort (minus Kai maybe) are all morally grey.
is there a reason why we wouldn't consider effie or jet morally good people. I feel like there is a good argument for sunny as well but i am a little biased towards him
Jet did take on kill orders from the Government. Yes this were all awakened, who already harmed civilians. But I'm not sure if i can consider someone who gets paid for killing humans a good person
Jet would 1000% kill any random awakened if she was low on essence she’s not a good person
Jet killed her own cohort back at antartica just so she could keep up her essence supply. It was during the fight with the black beetles during the fall of falcon Scott
I think ppl are just coping hard with this tbh, the prophecy is already fulfilled and with how things is going in current chapters sunny have negative % of fighting nephis again.
She has a set of principles but she is mostly morally grey, to almost amoral. She tries to humanize and keep grounded but life hasn't been kind to her. Nephilim are different. The sun god smashed some void beings being passionate. Angels are void beings. Powerful and very alien.
Did you not finish Forgotten Shores arc? It’s pretty clear the vision of a shadow devourering an angel is their fight in crimson tower.
Just curious, but do you guys think there is a saint alive who could kill anvil or daerons shadow?
They can't weild will so maybe modret with preptime. Though the chances are still much less than 50-50.
High tiers with prep time,even then they would barely win. The current shadows of sovereigns don't have domain, weapons or armour. Just some abilities and pure physical.
Without the WILL they are just supreme beasts, so any saint who can defeat a great beast + human intelligence + supernatural abilities. But they must have some advantage with Sunny's domain
When dearon was half dead, bleeding, mad, tired from continuous fights with the butterfly for over a month and well corrupted.
Without Domain, Will, aspect, equipment or even most of his intelligence, Anvil would be somewhere at the level of Supreme Monster-Devil (depending on how much self he retained), and low one at that due to human size. High tier saints should be more than capable of defeating opponents like that.
Considering Anvil did more forging than fighting, it's not necessarily the case that he retains as much of the latter as of the former
What if it's already taking place? What if the final Nightmare is the story that is Shadow Slave itself? This whole thing that we're witnessing is just someone's sixth or perhaps even seventh Nightmare to ascend beyond Divine
Hes prob gonna do sacred naturally so the next one will be the 6th nm from the gate on the moon
Idk about the next but what if the final nightmare is reenacting the sealing of the void and forgotten god to prove to the spell / weaver (if bros still alive) that you are capable of doing so to become divine and then acting it out in the present. Because let’s be fr the spell is probably a big plot to gather enough strength from all the realms after the doom war to reseal the void
On a side note, with how these guys sometimes, actually most of the time just happy go lucky bullshit their way into a solution, he might not even be sealed away again this time
As to what will be the NM, I think it will be related to the Nine. As in their battles and the adventures they got into as Sovereigns. It would be a shame to not get a proper arc dedicated to the Nine after hyping them up so much.
Then they're most probably gonna have to kill the nine,just as they had to kill the seven immortals of the chained isles. Why? Neph's [NEPHILIM] attribute. Eurys could tell at a glance, and I'm pretty sure the stronger she gets(rank and class) the more it reeks
Cassie is such a perv.
It would be super weird to be touching yourself while watching your best friends go out on a date. Just sayin. Also the fact that she can “experience” everything and nephis and sunny are doing it nowadays is also kinda hilarious.
No one can convince me that cassie didn't enjoy sunny and nephis' upstairs pillow fight through their senses. She can't be found out, and she was terrebly flustered when sunny teased her about the ruckus
Okay, now imagine the scenario, Nephis' army is fighting, and one of the enemies starts interfering with her domain, making the domain not reach some people or cohorts. Since her soldiers are mentally conditioned not to care about pain and injuries, this will make them unaware that they are dying. Since their instinct for self-preservation will be turned off.
It doesn't suck at all tbh. As a sleeper he already has a memory to counter his Flaw. And even he admits he would basically be fine after Awakening, and get more help, resources from his clan. So if he survived FS, his flaw is basically solved. That's why ppl always bring up what if with him, op power with a very solvable Flaw.
Honestly, as far as flaws in SS go, Caster's is a weird one. On the one hand, it is outstandingly debilitating. On the other, it can be solved, either by memory or by reaching a rank with inexhaustible lifespan. It is simply weird for a flaw to potentially become a non-issue.
Isn't it the same with Effie? As she rises through the ranks her body needs less food, less water and less oxygen. If she ever reaches the divine rank, she might need no food at all
Effie's flaw also enhances her libido and her stamina only grows more inexhaustible through ranks.
According to Effie herself, her flaw "enhances all her bodily needs", with sex among those.
Cassie isn't really that debilitated with her blindness anymore. Sunny can effortlessly manage conversations without his Flaw bouncing back. Jest by all rights should have been dead due to his Flaw, but is one of the most dangerous Saints around.
I even thought his skill at a higher level would mean taking away the remaining time of his opponents if he successfully killed them.
Caster is proof that the rule "the stronger the aspect the stronger the flaw" is far from absolute. Even tho his aspect is strong for the Ascended level
He was one of the strongest sleepers he would have definitely been one of the strongest saints if he had lived long enough to get there.
Sunny mentioned that his army is not coordinated and that he can feel the thoughts of his shadows. Maybe his supreme battle art involves guiding and controlling them? Maybe controlling and guiding them would allow hiim to copy their attributes?
He manipulated all the events, Cassie was just a Pawn in his big game. He wanted Sunny to be Forgotten, So that, him getting popular couldn't elevate Forgotten god's awakening and that's why he placed VTB with Oblivion's grave in TOA.
If that is the case, then everyone with the divine bloodline should be a vessel for revival. And why would he decide to kill his father?
However, fate exists prior to the weaver, which is why the nightmare spell is an unimaginably convoluted apotheosis ritual. That's why they created it with the strings of fate.
Well spell is merging all the realms which we know to be god's real bodies. My guess would be creation of "elder" god. Something that has influence on all realms and has humongous strength. To fight strongest forgotten dream god.
That looks horrifying. Imagine swimming in the pitch black depths with thousands or millions of cubic tons of water crushing on your body. Your body is constantly in a state of agony, as if lava was being poured apon your skin. Your mind screams in agony yet you are not being able to make a sound, your jaw refusing to open in the glacial water. A faint light starts pulsating far into the distance. You think that you have finally seen something. It could be a long lost artifact. It could be a discarded toy a toddler once owned. it could even be a monster. Anything would be better than the crushing sensation on your back. As you swim closer, you are horrified to find a greenish ribbon floating in the depths. It quakes, throbs, shivers and bends effortlessly in the freezing water. You realize, you didn't find it. No, it found you.
She is getting folded by 1/7 of him without any killing intent and lost to Transcendent titan Sunny.
I hope he stops fighting useless opponents soon, and by that I mean foes who can both kill him for real and deal lasting damage or force him to retreat in despair leaving dead the corpses of his friends behind (Effie, Kai ...) Or permakilling Saint or another Shadow, or one of his 7 shadows, destroying his memories, breaking some of his cores.
Either this is rage bait or your reading comprehension level is alarmingly low.
You're not getting it, the author set up a conflict in the story and you're like why are they fucking when she doesn't remember? That's the whole fucking point. It's like saying "why does Raskonikov kill that woman, I don't like this, this is bad" That's the whole reason for the plotpoint. Learn to engage with literature and let the story play out ffs.
