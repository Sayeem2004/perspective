It is also interesting that today's guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar,0.016712861
Can you perhaps explain to me what a gittern is?,0.04711028
A gittern was a fairly small gut strung round-backed instrument from around the 13th century,0.04686289
okay so kind of like an old ukelele? If that's a fair comparison,0.09872158
It was quite popular with court musicians, minstrels, and amateurs,0.0438942
That's pretty cool, I bet it was really easy to take it with you everywher,0.05354243
Yes, and it was used in Minstrel shows, which was an American form of entertainment developed in the early 19th century.,0.009990019
would those type of shows be in theatres or other areas?,0.01438814
I love my new electric guitar, I rock out every day since getting it.,0.028149333
That is cool how do you feel about Jimi Hendrix an American rock guitarist.,0.017718147
I love him, he's one of the all time greats; its too bad he was here for such a short time.,0.03357032
Yes you are absolutely right about that so young, the tender age of 27 years old when he died in London.,0.031331215
Yeah, he could have written so many more great songs, its a real shame.,0.25084448
It is really a shame. So how did you find out about guitars?,0.17545098

Guitar,0.01633588
They usually have 6 strings to them.,0.053295042
yes, my favorite is the electric guitar.,0.028974265
The pickups inside of electric guitars allow them to send vibrations to an amplifier.,0.05725329
Oh i did no know that.  Are there several types of different electric guitars or do they function the same?,0.01426248
Yes if the vibrations aren't being sent through an amplifier they are going straight out of the guitar itself.,0.039226998
Ah the vibrations seem to be the key the the guitar.,0.112850055
Yes strumming on the strings creates these vibrations which is the origin of the sound.,0.056758508
I want to learn guitar, the fretted instrument with six strings.,0.09872158
Yeah, I play. It's not too hard once you understand that basics.,0.03062413
Cool, do you play acoustic or electric guitar?,0.034041706
I play the acoustic. Do you know how long people have had guitars?,0.021549871
Well the modern guitar was preceded by several other variations which date back 500 years.,0.01017851

Oh yes! Good taste in music, although, I truly like a little of every music genre give or take a couple,0.09308127
I know what you mean, I like some hip hop as well. Mostly the early stuff from rappers in the south or West Bronx.,0.021314176
I feel the same and not fond of the mumble rap. There's something about listening to guitar that is deeper, though. It's hard to explain,0.040925518
Ugh I hate mumble rap, especially Future and that Chief Keef guy. I don't think they're even saying real words!,0.39231625
Haha I doubt they are. Ozzy Osbourne kind of sounds like that nowadays too!,0.034748793
I love Ozzy! Especially Black Sabbath! Paranoid was my favorite album. I love listening to War Pigs while driving really fast!,0.07608539
One of my favorite musical instrument to play,0.017215505
What is your favorite musical instrument to play?,0.017843807
Guitar is my most favorite to play,0.019226074
I have l always wanted to learn an instrument.  What would be the easiest?,0.019603057
I think piano and guitar will be easy to learn... But my suggestion is about learning Guitar which is very interesting to play,0.024378212
Can I learn piano or guitar without knowing how to read music?,0.026617315
I think it wont possible to learn guitar completely without learning music,0.045378547
I want ot learn something fast and easy.  How about drums?  Is that easy?,0.030034892
I love playing the guitar! It's also the most popular six stringed instrument.,0.023199737
It is a great instrument i love it too,0.030741978
When it's played acoustically, a hollow box amplifies the sound.,0.015770407
I like the sound of a electric guitar,0.08083374
I mainly enjoy the acoustic guitar. It was preceded by older instruments such as the gittern, the four-course Renaissance guitar and the five-course baroque guitar.,0.010995304
I remember seeing a small guitar on time itas called alute,0.027442247
Yes, lutes are similar but have a round back,0.06184035
They seem a little bit easier toplay,0.044388983
They may be. Guitars too produce sound by resonating the vibration of the strings in a hollow chamber.,0.025320992
Do they make electric accustic guitars?,0.02638162
I've always enjoyed playing the guitar. It's always traveled with me and been a great stress relief.,0.017215505
The guitar is a fretted musical instrument, I used to play the guitar. I'm not very good though.,0.09308127
Really? What types of songs or music were you into when you played?,0.03781283
My first guitar was an acoustic guitar, in which The sound is projected acoustically. I played mostly contemporary rock at the time. Do you still play?,0.0201057
I do. I'm mostly into country or Americana, although I pretty much only play for myself now.,0.027206551
Do you use an acoustic for that?  The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body.,0.03309893
Yes, the acoustic tends to be better for it. I've got a 12-string, actually, that is quite good at playing that type of music.,0.019980038
Oh that is interesting, most guitars only have 6 strings, what do you use a 12 sting for?,0.029327808
I've always wanted to learn the 6 string instrument know as the guitar,0.025203144
I play it actually! Do you prefer the electric or the acoustic?,0.02920996
I like both, but I think I prefer the electric more. The vibration occurs when the musician strums or plucks the strings,0.11212669
Yeah, it's pretty awesome. It does take some practice though to learn.,0.019477395
I bet there is a learning curve for sure! I'm not sure I have the hand-eye coordination to strum or pluck the strings while fretting the strings with me other hand,0.103928015
Yeah, then imagine trying to sing on top of all that!,0.03545588
Oh no way! Do you play the acoustic or electric?,0.037105743
I play acoustic mostly. It's a lot easier although I did play in a rock band when I was younger.,0.017466826
Oh that's awesome, have you ever played the classical guitar, steel-string acoustic or jazz string guitar?,0.029563503
I really enjoy the classical! They use nylon stings and it sounds amazing!,0.046120718
I love to play guitar. The six strings and the frets help to make the most beautiful sound.,0.029799197
I don't know much about guitars. My son has one.,0.024378212
Is his an acoustic with a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box, or an electrically amplified guitar?,0.02638162
His is acoustic.,0.079250954
Someday he might even like to try a jazz guitar that was invented once electric amplification increased the volume of the traditional acoustic guitar.,0.022964042
Sounds like it would have a nice sound.,0.017969469
It does. It is mostly used to play styles of jazz music.,0.010806813
I really think the acoustic has the best sound though.,0.019854378
Everyone has their favorite. The acoustic guitar's tone  is produced by the strings' vibration and amplified by the hollow body of the guitar which functions as a resonating chamber.,0.02343543
All music is certainly beautiful.,0.021549871
I play the guitar, do you?,0.030506283
I really want to! They're instruments that are usually 6 stringed.,0.04240986
Yes. I play an hour each day.,0.014639461
Nice! Do you prefer acoustic or electric guitars?,0.029092113
Guitar,0.01633588
Cool! They both sound really different, since they project sound differently.,0.016712861
I prefer acoustic, better sound.,0.02035702
Oh nice, me too! I guess it's the hollow wood that helps.,0.022846194
Yes and do not need an amp.,0.027206551
True, the electric guitar amplifiers are probably really clunky and expensive.,0.08083374
I just learned to play the guitar.  Do you play the guitar?,0.026970858
I do!  I have an electric Guild and an acoustic Seagull.  What do you play?,0.025674535
Well I must be honest, I have not gotten to know the entire family of guitars.  I just began to play using Guitar Hero, the game.,0.020231359
I have a Wii and play Guitar Hero on there as well!  Sometimes it's harder than the actual guitar though,0.023199737
Though the game was first released in 2005, it was not until recently that I became interested.,0.015958898
How many versions are there?,0.015644746
I am not quite sure, however, I know there are few versions that have been released.  I learned with the Classic Rock version.,0.01419965
I have that one and the Aerosmith version.  I have been wanting to get a new one but don't know what else there is,0.02107848
As of late I have been trying to learn songs from the album Bat Out of Hell by Meatloaf.,0.1641865
That's a good one.  What's your favorite song on that record?,0.011435116
I like playing guitars. how about you?,0.029445656
The guitar is a beautiful instrument. I play a little.,0.030741978

Nobody knows for sure, but it had predecessor instruments, as well. Dating before the baroque period.,0.015581916
Wow, what era was that?,0.017215505
The gittern was one of the instruments before the guitar, as well as the vihuela.,0.019351736
How many different types of guitars are their? I know you can get a six string and a 12 string.,0.023199737
There are many. The guitar is a type of chordophone. It has a gut and is made of wood,0.05255287
i like guitar,0.027442247
Are you referring to the fretted musical instrument?,0.046120718
yes,0.015896067
Well, the sound is projected acoustically so it requires a lot practice to become proficient!,0.01633588
Really?,0.009173225
Yes, it is typically played by strumming or plucking the various strings so you have to be precise,0.045625936
I like the sound of guitar,0.026970858
Thats because the guitar is a type of chordophone which makes sounds pleasant to the human ear.,0.02449606
Yes it is,0.014011159
I also own a Vivette, which is the four-course Renaissance guitar, its very expensive!,0.01847211
I love playing my guitar and making up new songs, Do you know about the guitar?,0.03192045
I do. The guitar is an instrument that usually consists of six strings.,0.014827953
Yes and I hear some can have 8 strings. But those are really hard to play, Do you have any favorite guitar songs?,0.028974265
I have two types of guitars. I have a hollow wooden one for acoustic and I also have an electric one. The electric guitar is my favorite.,0.026028076
Yea my dad used to play the electric guitar, Do you know when they first came out?,0.023199737
Guitars have been around for a really long time. its preceded by the gittern, baroque, and the vihuela.,0.023553278
I bet, I hear people played them in ancient greece, But I am not sure. Did guitars always start out with six strings?,0.030388435
The instruments I mentioned previously all varied. I also enjoy playing the steel-string guitar. I sometimes play the jazz guitar also.,0.01847211
I hear they use the steel string guitars mostly in country music.,0.020231359
Steel-string guitars are pretty popular with country musicians but also blues.,0.01633588
Okay. I play guitar. I can do solos. I play real good. Minor scale. Major scale. Modes. Up and down the fret. All day long.,0.030034892
What inspired you to start playing the guitar? Was there a specific band or music that got you into it?,0.034513097
I wanted t ake the Tom Morello sounds from Rage Against the Machine when I was a kid. I was like "wow! Guitar can make that sound! How can it be!!",0.039226998
It's really amazing what the best guitarists can do with the instrument. For me it was Guitar Hero the game. I ended up picking up the bass guitar first.,0.019980038
The bass is a noble insturment. I used to play bass in a band in high school. I was ignorant and tried toplay along with the guitar instead of using a rythym that bolsters the drum beat. I was too arrogant. Do you bolster the drum beat with your playing?,0.29405528
I was taught to play to support the bass drum beat and also balance out the main guitar's melody in between. I think that's what really made it attractive for me. The music sounded so empty without the bass beats.,0.03192045
Oh wow. You really know your stuff. Who is a cool bass guitar god for you?,0.11192002
Definitely has to be Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers.,0.06579731
I am looking at buying a guitar. Can you tell me more about them?,0.018095128
Yes absolutely! They are a nice fretted stringed instrument. Usually six strings but you can also get a 12 string.,0.04067813
Ok. I heard there is acoustic and electric. What is the difference?,0.018849092
Well for the acoustic, the body is hallow wood. The electric has an electrical amplifier and played through a speaker.,0.013822667
I think I will go with acoustic so I don't have to buy more equipment. What else can you tell me?,0.019477395
Well it takes some practice. But you can learn to play by strumming or plucking the strings. You can use your thumb and fingernails. In the beginning your fingers will probably get a little sore.,0.05824285
Yeah I heard some people use a plastic "pick" so they don't have to use their fingers.,0.033334624
Yes this is true. They are made of plastic or sometimes wood or even glass.,0.012063419
Wow I will have to decide what is best for me. Thanks for your help getting me started!,0.01608456
No problem. Also there are different types of acoustics. There is the modern acoustic, as well as the classical acoustic which has nylon strings. I love the sound of nylon, but typically it's only used for classical music.,0.016712861
I started playing the guitar at 13 years old, I took classes in school.,0.024142517
That's cool! Do you play acoustic or electric guitar?,0.02638162
I play both but I prefer acoustic, it feels more real to  me.,0.021314176
The guitar strings always hurt my fingers. I did better with classical nylon strings than steel.,0.03828422
It takes a bit of time to get used to the strings, that's for sure. Do you currently play?,0.03875561
No, I never could get the hang of it or develop the callouses.,0.15822013
How long did you try for?,0.017843807
I guess about a year. How long did it take for you to get good?,0.05725329
how well can you play the guitar?,0.04686289
Not very well! I'm not very well versed in musical notes and playing instruments. With guitars I'm amazed how so many different sounds can come from a hollow wooden wood box!,0.033334624
Would you ever like to learn how to play?,0.17631748
I think if I was to pick up a guitar it would be the electric guitar because of it's stellar sound.,0.044388983
thats is a really good choice, who is your favourite musician,0.02920996
Paul McCartney is my favorite. He is actually an avid guitarist and has played many different kind of guitars such as the bass guitar! Who is your favorite musician?,0.019351736
post Malone is a current favourite , I like he range of genres,0.026263772
Post Malone is rather interesting I think my favorite song from him is "Too Young" it's very catchy,0.029917045
Have you ever played the guitar, it sounds so beautiful, I would love to learn how to play one,0.083999306
Yes i love playing the guitar, The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box,0.026970858
Oh wow, that is so complex, I figured it was something simple. Are there different types of guitars,0.031213367
Yes, The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings, wich makes them have lots of variaties,0.021785567
I see, so are there other types of chordophones?,0.018849092
There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: the classical guitar (nylon-string guitar), the steel-string acoustic guitar, and the archtop guitar,0.015204934
I think I prefer the acoustic guitar, it seems to have a softer sound than the classical guitar.,0.019477395
the electric guitar is pretty good too, The vibration occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks, fingerpicks, or taps the strings,0.10522962
I forgot about the electric guitar! No wonder it has such a unique sound. Have people been playing guitars for a long time?,0.020842785
Yes, im pretty sure guitars have ben around for a while,0.034984488
I've always wanted to learn to play guitar, but I'm quite intimidated by it,0.102626406
It can be especially when you realize that there are 3 types of modern guitars. The classical guitar, the steel-string acoustic guitar, and the arch top guitar,0.016210219
Wow. I had no idea. Do you play each of them differently?,0.016712861
They have different frets. The classical guitar has 12 frets while the steel string guitar has 14,0.017466826
Oh cool. And what is a fret?,0.048099842
A fret is raised portion of a stringed instrument.,0.044883765
Do the three types of guitars make different music?,0.017089844
They are basically played the same way. When you strum the strings, the vibration is amplified by the body of the guitar which acts as a resonator.,0.03357032
Hey there! I play guitar, the 3 stringed fretted instrument. Have you ever played?,0.08320791
I have not unfortunately, but it is for sure a instrument I want to learn. Do you play anything else?,0.024260364
No I don't I've dedicated all my creative energy to learning about the guitar. Mine projects sound acoustically and is made of wood. Although I have at times played an electric guitar with an amplifier.,0.017341165
That is cool! Which do you life better, acoustic or electric?,0.09828771
Definitely acoustic. I find it's very nice to play a traditional style instrument. It reminds me of the older guitars throughout history that were made of wood and the string made of gut. Guitars belong to a family of instruments called chordophones.,0.015330595
Acoustic guitars definitely have a more soothing traditional sound to them as well as comforting. I do not know much about the family of instruments but what others are included in chordophones?,0.011749268
It would include all stringed instruments that produce sound by vibrating the strings. Like the banjo, harps, things like that!,0.049336795
Ooo the harp is another instrument that is interesting to me! Just a simple instrument with beautiful sounds. Any others interest you?,0.057748068
Hm... right now my passion is the acoustic guitar. I love the tone amplified by the hollow body of the acoustic guitar. It's like heaven!,0.034513097
Can't argue that! How long have you been playing for?,0.04166769
I love listening to the sounds of the guitar, especially the electric guitar, do you know anything cool about guitars?,0.03639866
I know its a six string fretted instrument and sounds pretty cool,0.045378547
Yeah I think some guitars can have less than six strings actually, like bass guitars sometimes, not positive though.,0.021903414
I love the sound of electric guitar the sound comes through an electric amplifier,0.09351514
Yeah the amp really helps make the sound very loud and intense, and you can use amp settings to customize the sound.,0.027324399
A guitar is a type of chordophone usually made from wood and strung with nylon or steel string,0.017843807
That's interesting, what exactly is a chordophone?,0.01633588
Main guitars are usually classical nylon string, acoustic and the archtop (Jazz) guitar,0.016210219
Right I understand the main types of guitars, but I'd like to know what exactly a chordophone is? Can you tell me?,0.016712861
all guitars are a type of chordophone normally its constructed of wood and strung with nylon or steel strings,0.028385026
I love watching people play guitar. I can't play myself, so it's fascinated to see other people with the skill to play well.,0.028031485
Our modern guitar was preceded by the glittern, a Renaissance guitar.,0.021785567
How does it differ from modern guitars?,0.010743983
Instead of having six strings, it was a four-course instrument.,0.019226074
Only four? Must have been easier to play than six! When did six strings become a thing?,0.028856417
That I am not sure of.,0.011120965
Who invented the guitar anyhow?,0.022374803
I do not know who gets the credit, but the four-course vihuela and the five-course baroque guitar contributed to its development.,0.013697007
I wonder what types of music were played back when the guitar was first invented. Would you happen to know?,0.017843807
I do not know, but it is presently used in every style of music.,0.016587202
guitar is a cool instrument,0.02402467
It really is. I love that there is more than one type of acoustic guitar, i.e. the classical one, the steel-string one and the archtop. Each has a different sound.,0.01419965
oh yea its so cool,0.030034892
It is. I love the sound of old types of guitar too, like the vihela and the baroque guitar. They are part of the modern day guitar's history.,0.012000589
yea i agree, a good acoustic is amazing,0.020607091
It's funny how it's designed so the hollow body acts almost like an echo chamber, resonating sound when you pluck the strings.,0.049336795
yea its quite impressive design,0.022021262
I think I prefer acoustic guitars to electric ones. The sound is more traditional than hearing it through an electrical amplifier and speaker.,0.019728716
Two things in life I adore. Sleeping and playing the guitar. Wish I could do both at the same time.,0.079250954
That's funny.  I enjoy the guitar myself.  Now, do you use an acoustic guitar, or do you go for the electric guitar with amplification?,0.030741978
I do it all is there one thats best?,0.029799197
It really is just a matter of preference.  There are basically three types of guitars: the acoustic guitar, the steel-string guitar, and the "jazz" guitar.,0.014890783
I think the acoustic guitar is the most romantic. I like to play that the most. Really trying to get noticed.,0.033334624
I can understand that for sure.  I agree with you.  The tone of the classic guitar is awesome.  The way it sounds through the hollow wood is so pleasing to the ear.  Just beautiful!,0.013508516
Do you know what the most popular guitar type is?,0.018849092
That may be the "air" guitar.  Everyone I know plays that one!  Ha.  There are actually organized air guitar competitions now.  So, if one can't play it, they can pretend they do!,0.031331215
I want to play the guitar!,0.036634352
The guitar is fretted an the instrument has six strings.,0.04166769
Is it hard to learn?,0.025792383
The tone of an acoustic guitar is made by vibration of strings witht he body of the guitar being hollow which is a chamber to produce the sound.,0.025792383
Ok so It seems that I would just have to learn how to properly string the strings. Any favourite guitarists?,0.033806015
There are three types of acoustic guitar. The classical guitar the archtop guitar which is also known as jazz guitar. Also the steel string guitar.,0.0143253105
Right, and which do you prefer?,0.012440401
a guitar is played by strumming strings or plucking them. You can use thumbs , finger nails or with a pick.,0.038048524
I wish i could learn to play guitar! I own an accoustic guitar and can't plau it,0.07371122
Its not too hard, I love tone a guitar makes, the strings' vibration really make for a good vibe, I learned how to play on a hollow body guitar inside of a resonating chamber.,0.06817148
i love the way it sounds as well! Where did the guitars come from,0.036870047

i've never heard of vihuela before! how interesting,0.023317585
Yeah Vihuela's were used from the 15th and 16th century in Spain, Portugal and even in Italy, It also had five or six doubled strings on it like a guitar.,0.019854378
I wanna see the picture of it. I will google it,0.059974585

acoustic mostly. I have a new baby so the steel-string is to loud.,0.026263772
Acoustic is my favorite guitar sound. The tone is from the strings' vibration.,0.056758508
Yes, it relax's my baby. I play her to sleep.,0.23343207
I bet that is soothing since the sound comes from a wooden box.,0.043646812
I want to learn to play classical but I just don't have enough time.,0.03192045
Hey, do you play or know much about the guitar?,0.055274166

Well, a guitar is pretty much a long instrument with six strings. Many radio stars play it in their songs.,0.017341165
yea, i have seen one but i think i will love to learn it, when was it produced?,0.022846194
That's cool, I'm not sure when it was produced, but the tone it makes is produced by the strings vibration. The vibration is amplified by the guitars' hollow body.,0.09112182
ok, so do you play the guitar?,0.030977672
I play it a little bit, I'd really like to learn it more, like you said. Do you play any type of instrument?,0.029327808

I don't. I know the sound is either acoustic, using hollow wood or plastic, or electric amplifier and and a speaker.,0.013508516
So can you explain the difference beweeen the types,0.016838523
Well, the modern acoustic has three types, classical guitar which is nylon string, the steel string acoustic and the archtop guitar.,0.012503231
How about the .other types?,0.015330595
The tone for an acoustic guitar is made by the vibration of the strings, and the hollow body amplifies it, and that acts as a resonating chamber.,0.020231359
Howon,0.021196328
Of course, as you know, a person strums or plucks the strings with a pick, while fretting the strings with the other hand.,0.06500591

I downloaded a book that says it will make me a guitar ninja, but the going is slow.,0.039226998
Good luck, i'm sure you'll get there! The tone of an acoustic guitar is made by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber.,0.02873857
I need to re-string my guitar, even though I haven't played much.  I am going to put nylon strings on instead of metal.,0.028856417

Do you know when the guitar first gained popularity,0.026617315
There were many different types that preceded the guitar. There was the vihuela, gittern, four-course Renaissance guitar, and baroque guitar.,0.011812098

So they've been around a while then. I know there are different types of guitar, but don't really know much about them. Any ideas?,0.021314176
Well my personal favorite is Acoustic guitars.  The transmit sound by vibrating the strings and do not use electronic amps,0.032156147
That's what I used to have. I agree with you - they're my favorite, too. What else do you know about guitars? You obviously know more than me!,0.02685301
The guitar is actually considered a type of chordophone, only it is distringuished by its different construction,0.02072494
Hmm. I didn't know there was much difference. Interesting. What is the construction difference?,0.014639461
The different construction using the nylon or steel strings,0.021549871

She actually needed surgery to remove the "sac" that had developed on her vocal cords,0.112953395
Wow, and everything went smoothly? no complications?,0.019477395
I have played the guitar for 35 years. It is a threaded musical instrument with six strings but is much more than that to a great many people who play.,0.015958898
Tell me more about that, I dont play nothing.,0.02072494
I play both acoustic guitar which is an instrument that's basically a hollow wooden box and I also play electric guitar which is basically a slab of wood with pick ups that turn the strings movement into electrical signals.,0.022846194
That is amzing, I wish you were her to play for me. i would love to hear that.,0.031684756
One of my favorite musicians is Robert Smith he led the band called the Cure throughout the late 70s and early 80s. He has a very distinct voice and unique stage look.,0.009801528
I have never heard of him actually. I normally just listen to whatever is trending.,0.02343543

i like ant man, but the other marvels are for sure my favorite.,0.030034892

How does an electric guitar work?  How does it pick up the sounds from the strings?,0.016021729
An electric guitar is a guitar that uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, i used to be really good at it,0.03309893
Did you only play electric, or did you play an acoustic guitar as well?,0.045873325
both but really enjoyed the electric more, The pickup used to sense the vibration generally uses electromagnetic induction to do so,0.079250954
How does moving one finger along the neck of the guitar, change the pitch of the string?,0.041915078
the pressure on the string changes making the sound different,0.027324399
Were you good enough to tune a guitar by ear, or did you need a tuner?,0.14429577

For all four years I was in Marching Band. We went to competitions and performed for hundreds of people!,0.015204934

Nah I've never played the guitar, but I want to learn to play an instrument at some point.,0.026617315
i love played guitar, the music gives me a plesant sound,0.038519915
Acoustic or electric guitar? They both produce different sounds.,0.009927189
i never played electric guitar just once i played the acoustic guitar.,0.024849601
That's cool, the acoustic produces sound with a hollow wooden or plastic box.,0.017592486
i used the hollow wooden to play, and i have practiced with that in a music class.,0.029327808
Did you strum with your finger, thumb, or nail?,0.20973456
at first with the card then i used with the thumb,0.03781283
Do you play acoustic or electric guitar?,0.023553278
I actually do not play either one.,0.01822079
Would you like to learn to play the guitar?,0.11367676
I would love to. Can you teach me?,0.02343543
Im sure you know the basics of plucking the strings with your fingers or often a pick.,0.11150667
I mean I have attempted it. But no success.,0.024613906
Each of your fingers has a label on the guitar. Index = i, middle = m, ring = a, and thumb = p. This helps in reading music and playing songs.,0.020607091
Ok. Kinda like a typewriter...,0.024967449
I don't know a lot about type writers, but, I am sure you are correct.,0.019854378
well I don't know much about guitars but you seem to know your stuff!!!,0.05131592
I was in a band in college where I played the guitar.  It's my favorite instrument,0.017843807
Do you play the guitar.  My niece was learning how to play.  She was playing pretty good too.  The sound is a nice acoustic mix,0.026735162
I started by playing the acoustic, but my uncle gave me an electric so I play both now,0.04735767
What do you prefer?  she is pretty good at plucking the strings and strumming and just coming up with her own tunes,0.16043124
I personally prefer the electric.  I have a vintage Guild and the sound is incredible,0.043646812
wow thats really neat.  I read that the modern guitar was preceded by something called the gittern, the vihuela, the four course Renaissance guitar, and the five course baroque guitar,0.019603057
That's so cool!  I've never heard of those.  I wonder how they differ from the guitars we know now?,0.014136819
It said that they all contributed in some way to the modern 6 string instrument we have today,0.022964042
Do you know what year the original gittern was invented?,0.026735162
I have read that it was represented in the 13th century in western Europe,0.026499467
I wish I could play the guitar.,0.026028076
If only I can see you in person, I can tell you more about how to play the guitar.  You play it by strumming or plucking the strings with your fingers while pressing against the frets on your other hand.,0.0969861
It sure sounds like it requires a lot of coordination.,0.013382856
It does take some practice - there are usually six strings that you need to press against the frets to make various chords and when you combine enough of these chords together, you get a song.,0.017843807
Are there many different types of guitars?,0.01847211
Yes - there's a lot of different variations of guitars.  For example, a bass guitar has a similar appearance but only has four to six strings and longer neck.  It sounds totally different as well.,0.016964182
Is one easier to play than the other? Or does the number strings not make that much difference?,0.024849601
The more strings there are, the harder it would be to play as your hand would need to be stretched out more.  With that said, there is also the electric guitar, which is similar to the guitar but uses pickups to convert the sound of the strings into electrical signals.,0.014136819
I bet learning the guitar would open up more new skills, with all the coordination!,0.020607091
Sure thing - you can be a music teacher or a guitar player in a band.  All the famous guitarist you probably know are amazing electrical guitar players.  The cool thing about electric guitars is that you can alter the sound of the signal and change the timbre of the sound.,0.014639461
I love knowing that there are three main types of modern acoustic guitar.,0.020960633
Can you tell me more about that?,0.012691722
I would be happy to, they are: the classical (nylon strings), the steel-string acoustic guitar, and the archtop guitar which is sometimes called a  jazz guitar.,0.021196328
That is amazing, I think my girlfriend actually owns one of those.,0.025792383
I have tried to play the guitar but right now I'm focusing on another stringed instrument: The Ukulele.,0.026617315
I can not play anything, but I do love to hear people play. It's the best thing ever.,0.027677942
I agree, music technology is at an amazing level right now and there are great things to listen to.,0.015142105
Music is not only the gateway to the soul. I think music is the soul. It truly is magical. Just like disneyworld at christmas.,0.022139108
Oh! I would love to experience disney world at christmas! (or anytime for that matter).,0.02072494
Disney world is amazing, i think we are going right before christmas this year and I truly can not wait.,0.02638162
I love playing my fretted musical, six string instrument! If you don't know what that is, well it's the guitar of course!,0.0969861
I had no idea i might have to look at getting one are they easy to learn ?,0.024260364
That all depends on a lot of factors, one including the type of guitar. The three main types are the classical guitar which uses nylon-string, the steel-string acoustic guitar and the archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar".,0.012880214
Very interesting information .  Is there anything else that you can tell me about fretted muscial ?,0.040925518
It is typically played by strumming the strings with your fingers, thumb or even fingernails. Sometimes people use a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets). That's where the term fretting instrument comes in.,0.044388983
Oh i see i was wondering what that word meant. Anything else you can tell me ?,0.018849092
Guitars are a type of chordophone which were traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or even steel strings and then distinguished from other similar instruments by its construction and tuning.,0.011435116
Oh wow so we have come a long way since that time.  Very interesting information,0.015016444
And before the six string guitar that we have today, it was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar and the five-course baroque guitar. All of which contributed to the development of what we see today.,0.010492661
Oh wow thats very nice .  I might have to look more into this,0.024378212
I have always wanted to learn to play the guitar. Do you know much about guitars?,0.02343543
I know a little. My younger brother can really play an electric guitar.,0.030388435
Is that the guitar you plug into a speaker?,0.05304765
Yep. The speaker you plug the guitar into is generally called an amplifier.,0.016210219
Oh. I suppose it is expensive to buy all of the equipment.,0.016838523
It really is. Especially if you get a big tube amplifier with 12" speakers.,0.015393426
Maybe I should stick with the traditional guitar. It might be easier to afford.,0.019728716
You could always go with a Fender Esquire. It is their budget brand of guitar. Basically it is a cheap version of their flagship stratocaster at one tenth the price.,0.024849601
I always thought guitars were pretty fascinating, do you know when they were created?,0.02343543
Sadly, I do not. But I do know that guitars are typically instruments that have six strings.,0.021432023
Well, duh! Do you have any favorite guitarists? My favorite is Jimi Hendrix!,0.028502874
Jimi Hendrix is friggin awesome! I would say my favorite guitarist, or bassist, is the one that performed with Hendrix, Billy Cox.,0.25915736
He's is definitely pretty good with the guitar too! Do you know any other cool facts about guitars?,0.019728716
Why yes, I do know that the sound of a guitar is either projected acoustically through hollowed out wood or plastic. Or it is projected using an amplifier.,0.012943043
Oh yes, I prefer electric guitars though. Those guitars are more cool looking and louder!,0.038048524
I do too! They are quite prevalent in the music genre Garage rock, also called 60's punk rock.,0.038991302
Although, I won't lie the wooden/plastic guitars have more history behind them. Are guitars related to violins in anyway?,0.03309893
Not much, other than that both are wooden instruments that use strings to generate music.,0.015958898
Guitars are great instruments!,0.02343543
guitars are super cool, very simple too.,0.030741978
They really are. They usually have 6 strings.,0.02920996
oh yea and hollow bodies?,0.09611836
The hollow body means more on the acoustic guitar than the electric.,0.025674535
oh yea that makes sense since you need to reverb from an acoustic,0.06896287
Yeah, most of the sound from the electric guitar is from the amplifier.,0.01419965
electric guitars are very intense,0.05205809
They are great though, I used to have an electric guitar and amplifier before.,0.021903414
yea i was bad at playing it tho.,0.06579731
I would love to learn to play the guitar. Do you know much about it?,0.02543884
I don't really know much about the guitar. I know that it usually has six strings. I feel like the guitar would be hard to learn.,0.025320992
It sounds so beautiful when it is played for soft ballads.,0.045873325
I agree with you. I love songs that are sung acoustically on the guitar.,0.020960633
Some of the more recent ones, like "Dear Hate" in country music are beautiful on guitar.,0.08479069
I've never heard of that one. Bob Dylan has been influencing music for over five decades with his guitar playing.,0.0131943645
He definitely is talented. What are some of his songs?,0.021432023
Some of his best songs are older. I like "Blowin" and "The Times They Are a-Changin". Do you know either of those songs?,0.033806015
I recognize those. They are classics.,0.01847211
"Blowin" has often been described a a protest song.,0.030506283
Are you a fan of the guitar? Conventionally, they have 6 strings.,0.027677942
Yes! I own a Yamaha guitar but it's been so difficult to self learn. Do you know when the first guitar was invented?,0.019980038
I'm not so sure, but it usually has a hollow wooden or plastic casing.,0.015644746
Yeah, they produce such a nice sound! Do you know how many variants you can get of the guitar?,0.02249265
It is a type of chordophone, for what that's worth. Some have guts and can tune.,0.08083374
That's interesting, i didn't know that. What else can you tell me about the guitar?,0.019100413
The tone is created by the vibration of the string.,0.11181668
Wow, those vibrations make good music! Do you know what the string can be made out of?,0.18364124
Some of them are made of nylon now! Others are made of steel.,0.01834645
I might have to switch my steel for nylon since it hurts my fingers haha! Thanks for the information! you're very knowledgeable :),0.030859824
I love playing guitar in my spare time,0.04686289
it is the best fretted instrument there is,0.11129999
Do you prefer acoustic or electric?,0.024142517
well the sound is different for both are different, for acustic it uses a wooden hollow hole for sound, thats what I prefer,0.039462693
I wonder what other instruments are similar to a guitar,0.017718147
well there are different types of guitars, of course electric, acustic, but there are also classical guitars, and steel-string guitar,0.02343543
Which kind came first?,0.020842785
technically the Lute was the first guitar type instrument,0.019351736
I love playing my guitar. It's my favorite fretted instrument.,0.04166769
I love guitar music too. I used to play classical guitar years ago.,0.017718147
It's just so much fun to strum and pick away at it for hours.,0.09785384
Yes, it is. It takes a lot of practice to be good, mind you. That was my downfall - not enough practice.,0.02107848
Did you play and acoustic guitar, or an electric guitar?,0.037105743
Acoustic. My parents bought it for me as a gift and arranged for guitar lessons from a very good guitarist. It was such fun!,0.011874928
I really enjoy the tone of an acoustic guitars. The way it resonates is so soothing.,0.034041706
Very soothing. Playing guitar can be a very relaxing thing to do - I may have to take it up again.,0.017215505
I love guitar music -- everything from classical to acoustic rock. How about you?,0.023671126
I love it too!  The sound of a fretted instrument with six strings is amazing!,0.03545588
Obviously it's been around for a long time...I wonder *how* far back it dates as an instrument?,0.018849092
I really don't know! But I do know that a guitar is usually made from wood,0.027560094
And different kinds - I imagine that different woods might give a different sound. That would be interesting to know -- what different guitarists prefer when it comes to the main material.,0.011874928
An acoustic guitar is something awesome!  Especially one with steel strings,0.04735767
I do love acoustic. A favorite album is Skin and Bones by the Foo Fighters -- lots of their most popular songs, stripped down. Beautiful!,0.032627538
Yes, the acoustic guitar makes lovely music!  It has a bright, loud sound,0.026735162

My favorite instrument in rock music is the drums.,0.024142517
Right! Yeah it's nice but very loud. My friend went almost deaf from playing too much. It's so nice though to play the collection of cymbals and percussion instruments with sticks.,0.03969839
It takes a lot of work to be a drummer.  Working that bass petal really hurts your legs.,0.21642438
Yeah! Do you ever use the double bass? What about woodblocks and cowbells?,0.02920996
I really like the guitar, I used to play it when I was in college, Have you tried playing the guitar?,0.030741978
no, i'm more a piano person but my husband has an accoustic six strings guitar,0.045873325
A six string guitar is what I had in college actually, I remember playing many songs for my room-mates, I'm curious who makes the majority of guitars in the US anyways?,0.020842785
i think Gibson company makes guitars. The modern guitar was preceeded by the gittern, the vihuela and the four course guitar,0.021785567

I have heard most rock has jazz notes in it,0.026145924

Do you have any songs you want to learn?,0.050573748
I'd have to say I want to learn most of the Johnny Cash discography at least right now, then move on to The Flashbulb.,0.03062413
I have never heard of that before,0.022139108
Well I assume you don't mean you've never heard of Johnny Cash, because he's one of the best-selling musical artists EVER.,0.021432023

Not really, just the idea of it is really interesting. Especially how they are either electric or acoustic.,0.017341165
I guess acoustic would lend itself to more flexibility. It would be great to be able to just pick up something like that and make beautiful music! Do you have a favorite musician?,0.02035702
There's too many for me to have a real favorite. The difference between the two different types of guitars is how the sound is projected, which I found really fascinating.,0.016021729
Very true. And I do like a variety of music. Do you prefer electric or acoustic? Or just depends?,0.014073989
I like acoustic more for the most part, as I like how the hollow wood sounds compared to the electric amp.,0.030270588
I do too. Hearing the Foo Fighters go acoustic on Skin + Bones made me fall for the music harder than had I just heard the electric versions of the songs.,0.048594624
Also the different types of strings make it sound different, as they can be made of gut, nylon, or steel.,0.020607091
I love how musicians can tell the nuances that every part of a guitar will bring to their music -- strings, body style, material -- it's like finding true love ;-),0.023317585
I play a lot of guitar but I think I sleep just as much. They're my two favorite hobbies.,0.023553278

There is for example industrial metal, like Ministry, Godflesh, KMFDM or Rammstein.,0.02048268
Interesting names for the bands. Sounds insane.,0.19314334
Haha, kind of. It developed in the late 1980s and then became to fuse into common genre.,0.03639866
I will look into it. I think I will jam it when I am getting ready to go out at night.,0.19870108
I love the guitar.,0.022374803
I do too but I can't play, so I pretend to play on guitar hero the game. It mimics the features of playing a real guitar.,0.024849601
Yes.  I have played the guitar hero.  I don't know how play well on that either.  Do you know anything about different types of guitars?,0.017718147
I know that most guitars usually have about six strings to them.,0.023553278
Yes; but are their not different types like a classical guitar, and an electric guitar?  That sort of thing?,0.015519086
Yeah classical guitars have a wooden frame around them and are considered acoustic.,0.014450971
How about electric guitars?  Those are my favorite.  What can you tell me about them?,0.021785567
Its pretty much just like a classical guitar but has electric pickups that convert the vibration of the the strings into electrical signals that are played through an amp to make music.,0.024849601
That is cool.  I love to hear both the classical and electric guitars played.  Each one has their own special sound to them.  Do you know any famous guitar players, or have a favorite guitarist that you listen to?,0.012063419
Eric clapton is one of my favorites, he was a blues guitarist back in the day.,0.019728716
I love to play the guitar.  It is described as a fretted instrument with six strings.  Do you play?,0.03734144
I don't but would love to if you convince me about it :),0.017089844
Its great to unwind and relax and play a few tunes, especially with friends round.  There are 3 main types, the acoustic guitar, the steel-string and the archtop.  I have just about masted the steel string so far.,0.016587202
Amazing, do you know the history of when they started using it?,0.023553278

Nice, what types of guitars are out there?,0.02779579
Well I think the coolest are the electric guitars.  They use one or more pickups to convert the string vibrations into electric signals.  examples are The Fender Stratocaster or The Gibson Les Paul,0.018849092
Amazing information. How much do you think it would cost to buy one?,0.011874928
You can pick up a cheap guitar for 40 dollars but for the The Fender Stratocaster you can be talking 1500 dollars or more!!,0.034748793
the guitar is a great musical instrument,0.02543884
Yeah I love the way it sounds.,0.018095128
its either a hollow wooden body or uses an amplifier,0.049584184
They both sound so different since one is acoustic and one is electric.,0.0201057
yea, guitars usually only have 6 strings,0.026028076
That makes sense, same with stuff like the bass.,0.01822079
you play it by plucking the strings with a pick,0.11057663
Can't you just use your fingers too?,0.22846605
yea fingers, thumbs, or fingernails all work,0.07450261
Hmm that's interesting!,0.017466826

Really? I had no idea they were so old. Do you know how old guitars have been around for?,0.022846194
I really do not.  I know it originated from something called the gittern,0.034984488
My friend plays the guitar, do you know much about guitars?,0.032863233
Not much,  but I know a few things.  For example, I know the guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel string.,0.019226074
That's interesting, what exactly is a chordophone?,0.01633588
A chordophone is a musical instrument that makes sound by way of a vibrating string stretched between two points.,0.049831573
That makes sense, do you know when the guitar was invented?,0.015204934
Not exactly, but the modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance and the five-course baroque guitar.,0.009927189
Wow it sounds like it has quite the history, what exactly is a gittern?,0.06500591
A guittern was a small gut instrument that first appears in literature during 13th century in Western Europe.,0.0414203
Fascinating, do you know anything cool about the electric guitar?,0.033806015
Well an electric guitar uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its string into electrical signals.,0.023788974
I would love to learn how to play the guitar.,0.06025757
Oh yeah? You mean the fretted musical instrument that has six strings?,0.09525062
Yes. I love the sound of it.,0.016964182
Yeah, the sound is projected acoustically using a hollow wooden or plastic box. That is what makes the sound so nice!,0.017341165
I prefer the acoustic guitar sound.,0.021314176
Me too. :) If you know how to play than you know that it is played by strumming or plucking the strings with your fingers, thumb or fingernails. using the right hand. The left hand is for pressing the strings.,0.036634352

Do you know how to play the guitar? My father used to play but i've never picked it up.,0.024260364
I do play a little but nothing major. I get a bit lost with the 6 strings and the frets.,0.044636376
Did you ever take lessons or just pick it up on your own?,0.16158698
I had classes for a few months but my teacher lost me when he tried to explain how each freat is a semitone in the standard western system and that an octave has twelve semitones.,0.059232414
well, you know more than I do. I don't even know what a semitone is.,0.11119666
A semitone is a half tone and is called the most dissonant when sounded harmonically. It's a bit complicated I would say but it's common in Western tonal music.,0.041172907
I'm not sure what that means but I will take your word for it. Do you have a favorite guitarist? I personally enjoy listening to Slash from Guns and Roses.,0.029092113
Yes I do like Guns 'n' Roses. Axl Rose also sings for AC/DC since 2016  and I do enjoy them!,0.019854378
I didn't know that. I sort of thought he disappeared after the last Guns and Roses album in 2008,0.032391842
Yes those bands rarely tour nowadays and AC/DC lost their lead singer after a heavy night of alcohol consumption in 1980 but still kept going!,0.067380086
Hi, I play the guitar do you?,0.028856417
I can't really play a guitar all that well but my brother is a wizz with his six string.,0.17198499

I started playing the violin myself recently, are there any instrumrnts you'd like to learn?,0.045378547
I often dreamed of learning to play the violin actually. But I just don't have talent with stringed instruments.,0.032156147
I love people that play guitar, don't really know how to play it. It is a fretted musical instrument,0.12086493
I have never played either.  What does fretted mean?,0.028385026
It means fragile instrument, it is also an instrument that has six strings,0.03781283
Interesting.  I guess it is fragile.  When were guitars created?,0.019100413
I don't really know but I know thatmodern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar,0.025320992

What do you mean by gut?,0.041172907
I love the sound of a guitar riff coming thru a huge amplifier. Wouldnt you agree?,0.036162965

Nothing Else Matters has some amazing guitar riffs.,0.024142517
Yeah it really does. I honestly listen to like almost every genre, but haven't like heavily explored rock enough to be honest. I like The unforgiven and where i may roam and sad but true among others a lot.,0.02873857
The Master of Puppets is a must listen to if your exploring Metallica. I love their gutarists Gibson guitar.,0.054037213
Ok ok. I think I've heard it but i'll give a re listen. It sais its the third studio album from Metallica. Do you lke other rock besides  metal?,0.03734144
