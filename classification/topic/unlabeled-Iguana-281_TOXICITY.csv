I think iguanas are so strang looking. They have rough skin and large eyes,0.15324512
Yes they have a row of spines down their back and a tiny third eye on their head.  Its odd!,0.28425202
I did not know about the third eye of iguanas. That is so weird!,0.08004235
Yes the green iguana is the most common - it is the one usually kept as a pet,0.032156147
I have seen several of iguana that were being kept as pets. They seem to just sit there all day.,0.11347008
Iguanas can live up to 20 years if they are cared for properly,0.048594624
Wow, that is so much better than the life expectancy of a hamster!,0.20973456
Most of the time though the diet and lighting and other conditions for iguanas in captivity are inadequate and they die within the first year :-(,0.069754265
Hi, I have few pet Iguanas. Do you?,0.049336795
No but iguanas are cool cold blooded lizards,0.23667802
I see, does that mean they are reptiles?,0.09958932
Yep iguanas are lizards so they are also reptiles,0.11398677
Yea that makes sense. What else do you know about Iguanas?,0.024613906
its cool also since The genus was first described in 1768,0.03875561
That was a long time ago. Are iguanas aggressive?,0.15545623
no iguanas are lizards so they are herbivores,0.17025198
Great! I hope to have more Iguanas as pets since they are herbivores,0.11347008
There are also two genus, green and Antillean iguana,0.102626406
I own a pet iguana, its a genus of herbivorous lizards that are native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, do you like iguanas?,0.042657252
I used to have a pet iguana! They can be a lot of fun.,0.04290464
Yes i had a big one, iguanas can range from in length, including their tail,0.102192536
I only fed my iguana fruits and vegetables. I heard that was better if you liked to handle them.,0.024378212
Me too, i had a blue iguana its one of the longest-living species of lizard, they live up to 70 years!,0.044388983
Wow! Parrots live for about that long too don't they?,0.09915545
Yes but there are roughly 393 species of parrots, so it can vary, they are native to in tropical and subtropical regions.,0.015393426
Oh of course. I guess I'm just thinking about common pet parrots like amazons and african greys.,0.13388206
i know :D most species of parrot can make excellent companions, the best ones are those who can mimic talk :D,0.0969861
I had an amazon parrot too. Alas... she only lived to be 35 due to heart disease.,0.037105743
I love iguanas. They are cool little creatures.,0.03969839
They are indeed!  They range in length, including their tail!  I had one when I was a child!,0.03969839
Was a it a good pet or cause lots of trouble taking care of? Was it nice or try to bite you and other people?,0.11357342
I thought it was a good pet, and it never tried to bite me!  I liked that it had small scales behind its neck that looked like spokes!,0.08320791
That's cool. Those spikes look awesome. They seem like pretty docile creatures.,0.051068526
Well, they don't stir up much trouble, unless they get loose and you can't find them!  LOL  And those spokes are called tuberculate scales!,0.1460314
Do they behave well with regards to potty control. I can imagine them peeing everywhere.,0.3389984
I don't know - I made my little brother clean up after it!  It's interesting that they are native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean.,0.043399423
That wasn't fair. Cleaning up iguana poop must stink. What did their diet consist of?,0.40614098
They like vegetables!  My iguana was blue and the blue ones are one of the longest-living species of lizard,0.04166769
Have you heard of the iguana? I think I want one as a pet.,0.04785245
Iguanas are popular pets in some areas. I have seen them on leashes,0.040925518
I see, do you have one?,0.02048268
No, I don't. But there areplenty wild ones in the neighborhood because they are native to tropical areas in the Caribbean,0.031331215
How many different species of iguana are there?,0.025556687
Actually, there are just two. The green iguana is the popular pet. The other one in the Antilles is endangered because of habitat destructions.,0.025085296
Oh we should do something to save the Antilles from extinction!,0.056263726
Yes, we should.  The word iguana comes from the Taino name for the species, "Iwana.",0.025674535
That makes sense. Are Iguanas aggressive or passive?,0.11305673
Actually, they are passive. They have a light sensing organ on top of the head which can see light but not details.  So they do not see very well.,0.054779384
I want to get an iguana so bad!,0.24924077
Do you mean the herbivorous lizards that are common to Mexico and Central America?,0.35186127
yes! They are so cute,0.031449065
Would you rather have a green Iguana, or a Lesser Antilles Iguana?,0.023906821
I don't know anything about lesser antilles iguana! Can you tell me more?,0.022846194
You want the blue one trust me.  What freaks me out about Iguanas are those spines running down their back and that third eye on their heads.,0.31132057
I think it's kind of cute :) What do iguanas eat?,0.028149333
Plants.  But you don't want an Iguana because they typically die in captivity.,0.09112182
i have a few pet iguanas i just got,0.08320791
Wow!  Those animals are amazing!  I have seen a few in the Caribbean.  I think I would have to get used to having something that big in MY yard!,0.030506283

Are they green iguanas?,0.031331215
yes, they are sort of greenish,0.05651112
The Green Iguana has become pretty popular in the United States in the last 20 years.,0.0143253105
I am a real novice, where do they originally come from?,0.044883765
They're native to Central America, South America, and the Caribbean, but have "traveled" to live in other areas.,0.019980038
do you know how long will they live? I may die before they do :),0.3250515
I heard that they are hard to maintain but can live up to 20 years!,0.01847211
Some day I want to get a pet iguana,0.16851899
That would be cool! The word Iguana is actually from the original name Taino, meaning iwana,0.018849092

Thats cool! I do know that behind their necks are small scales known as tubercular scales,0.25462922
Iguanas are native to the tropics of the Americas,0.067380086
I have not heard of that before. tell me more about Iguanas please,0.021785567
The Austrian naturalist Laurenti found them in 1768,0.03109552
Do they live in America?,0.020607091
I think so. Mostly in South America and Central America,0.019226074
I love learning about other cultures and I will definitely look for more info about them,0.024378212
Iguanas are actually herbivorous!,0.102626406

An iguana is an herbivorous lizard. Only plants!,0.09481675
that's goood to know! do they carry Salmonella?,0.019854378
I don't think so, but the  exact number of those infected by iguanas is unknown,0.07450261
i wonder if it's hard to get their environment right to keep as a pet?,0.05824285
i always wanted an iguana!,0.05230548
They would make a cool pet.  What Kind of Iguana do you want?,0.059974585
I honestly don't know! are there different types of iguanas?,0.04166769
Looks like there might be a few, but I'm not sure.  Maybe Blue and Green are they most common type.  The Green one come from Brazil and Paraguay,0.022610499
i didn't know that! What else do you know about iguana?,0.022021262
The Blue Iguana comes form the Grand Cayman.  I might not want an iguana for a pet but I'll visit where they are from any day!,0.029092113
I bet these Blue Iguanas are so beautiful,0.0466155
I agree they would be something to see.  I read that they can live up to 68 years old.  I had no idea they lived so long.,0.014450971
what?? I can't believe it! They live longer than any other pets i've ever had,0.11150667
That would be right up there with Parrots I think.  At least you'd have a companion for social interaction for a very long time!,0.024260364
I love Iguanas!  They have always been my favorite reptile.  First described in 1768 by an Austrian NIcolaus Laurenti.,0.028974265
What sets Iguanas apart from other reptiles like Lizard?,0.05131592
Well for one they can range in length, including their tails.  The name was derived from the Taino name "Iwana".,0.036634352

There are actually two types of Iguana as well.  The Green Iguana and the the lesser Antilles Iguana.,0.0154562555
So, what's the difference?,0.013948329
The lesser Iguana is a little bit smaller.  Both possess a dewlap though, which is a row of spines running down their backs to their tails.,0.085582085
Awesome. It sounds like a little dinosaur.,0.13908891
It could be!  Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles and we know that Iguanas are also reptiles!,0.07054565
I wonder if there are more types of Iguana though.,0.04240986
Iguana (, ) is a genus of herbivorous lizards that are native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, South America\,0.103060275
My next door neighbor had an Iguana as a pet.  I don't know why.  You can't cuddle with an iguana!,0.09438288
Two species are included in the genus "Iguana": the green iguana, which is widespread throughout its range and a popular pet, and the Lesser Antillean iguana,0.019351736
Theirs must be a green iguana, then.  I'm scared of them.  Do they bite humans?,0.20032968
The green iguana is also known as the American iguana, is a large, arboreal, mostly herbivorous species of lizard of the genus,0.08083374
Is there an ecological advantage to iguanas?  What do they eat?,0.022374803
sure! thats because they  iguana feeds almost exclusively on algae and large males dive to find this food source, while females and smaller males feed during low tide in the intertidal zone.,0.038048524
Really?  Can iguanas swim?,0.022021262
I have been told my neighbor's iguana got loose.  Should I be worried?  They kept it in the bathtub.,0.09033044
Do you keep lizards as pet?is a genus of herbivorous lizards that are native to tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, South America,0.1013248
I don't, my neighbor does.  I have a small dog that I worry about.  Are iguanas dangerous?,0.039462693
Well ,they dont seem to be,he genus was first described in 1768 by Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in his book "Specimen Medicum, Exhibens Synopsin Reptilium,0.031684756
Well I feel a little better, then.  What if I see the iguana?  How do I catch it?,0.03969839
Well it depends on the color you want to catch,either the green iguana or blue,0.026617315
Oh no.  I don't what color it is.  I think green?  Is that good or bad?,0.024613906
The blue iguana  also known as the Grand Cayman iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana or Cayman Island,0.012817383
I think if I see it I am just going to call animal control to get it.,0.075294
pls do! Moreso,In addition to the two species in the genus "Iguana", several other related genera in the same family have common names of the species,0.049336795
I have a pet Iguana a herbivorous lizard, his name is Lurch,0.08637348
That's sweet. What does he eat?,0.024849601
He eats Hibiscus flowers and has bumpy scales on his neck like spokes,0.3234372
Does he change colors?,0.023906821
No but the Lesser Antilean does and they are endangered,0.055768944
I see. How long does an iguana typically live?,0.18269104
Not sure? And they vary in range of length depending on species,0.028031485
How many species of iguana are there?,0.034984488
My friend's daughter has a green iguana, a popular pet apparently.,0.04785245
I love iguanas. Such cool and docile pets I have heard.,0.026970858
I just can't imagine.  The can live to be 20 years old!,0.03109552
WOW. I didn't know their life span was that long. Amazing creatures.,0.021314176
Iguanas have a dewlap, which is a spine and OMG a tiny 3rd eye on their heads! Creepy!,0.42568782
I never heard the term Delap. That is a cool name. I am definetly sure I never heard they had a 3rd eye.,0.051810697
I guess green iguana pets better than bule iguana.  They can live for up to 69 years! No way no way.,0.044141594
Holy. That is very long life span. More than triple that of the normal iguana.,0.048099842
Iguana ,please I really can't decipher the meaning,0.02920996
Iguanas are basically a type of herbivore lizards from tropical areas.,0.039935954
Lizard? Are they dangerous?,0.13214645
Nope, like I said iguanas are herbivores and therefore only eat plant life.,0.03734144
OK that's good,0.020960633
Yup, they were discovered quite a while ago too, as they were described as early as 1768 by Josephus Nicolaus.,0.012063419
What other type of lizard specie are there?,0.18269104
There are stuff like chameleons too. Though to stay on Iguanas, they can really range in size and length, especially when including their tail.,0.028149333

Well they range in colors and in addition many species are able to change their color.,0.025674535
I always wanted to get a pet iguana. They are herbivorous lizards from Central America.,0.19124292
Wow, that's an exotic pet! How big do iguanas get?,0.10870059
They can range in length depending on species. The biggest ones can be almost six feet!,0.024613906
Whoa! I can't imagine! And they are herbivorous, so no meat? I wonder what their favorite thing to eat is.,0.11129999
That is correct they are herbivorous lizards. They like all kinds of greens such as kale and lettuce.,0.19124292
Oh I seem to remember a kid I knew years ago had an iguana and they fed him lettuce. I wonder if they are very interactive with humans when they are kept as pets.,0.069754265
The green iguana is a popular pet and does interact with their owners. Especially when they know they are getting fed.,0.038048524
Ha, funny how the food brings them around. Do iguanas come in different colors? I think I have only seen green ones.,0.025792383
I hate Iguana I heard they are huge in Mexico.,0.47473195
Iguanas do look scary. Are they dangerous?,0.09872158
No despite them being very large in length and long with that huge tail they are won't harm but they do look like they will I still beware lol.,0.11347008
Yea I would definitely go the other way. What else can you tell me about these creatures?,0.10870059
They come in a range of colors from brightness like yellow, green and they have pale scale on they head they can blend in a lot with surroundings so always be careful.,0.083999306
Wow. They are somewhat fascinating. What do they eat?,0.038048524
They eat mostly plants, leaves green things so they won't eat you they are widespread around where it is mostly green always.,0.01847211
Oh I thought it would be insects. They dont seem as scary as I first thought now that I know a little more about them.,0.09351514
Do you like the genus of herbivorous lizards from tropical mexico and central america known as the iguana?,0.11378009
iguana are quite cool but can be annoying little guys when you get a lot of them,0.22980402
Yeah i bet. The word iguana is actually derived from the Taino for species iwana.,0.030859824
huh I didnt know that but it makes sense once you hear it,0.032156147
Yeah it does. On another note do you like the New  york stock exhange? The one established in 1862?,0.011120965
No real opinion to be honest, not something ive dealt with much in life,0.048594624
Oh true. I just like it because ive been to the fifth trading room located at 30 broad street.,0.01633588
oh thats quite cool, id like to visit new york in genral some day,0.030859824
It may seem odd to say, but I have Iguana, a genus of herbivorous lizards as a pet. I keep it just to have some partner whom can just be by my side,0.10175867
Wow. I don't really know much about lizards, especially Iguanas.,0.091913216
Mine is green iguana which is also known as American Iguana. They are very calm and attentive creatures which makes you just stare at them,0.034513097
I guess I have never thought of them as calm, probably because they make me nervous.,0.09308127
they are not that scary, but calm and relaxed creatures. Just like the novel series The "Warriors" depicts calm people as scary,0.055521555
I believe you. I just didn't know much about them and sometimes we fear what we don't understand. Maybe you could tell me more.,0.01646154
To get more acquainted and get rid of nervousness, i would recommend you to watch Nandini, an Indian supernatural television drama. That would help to a certain degree,0.08479069
I've never heard of that television drama. What is it about?,0.024378212
They are also much like BBC television dramas that have been produced to get you over the nervousness with smooth scenery shots,0.10566349
You seem to know so much. Are there any really cool facts about them?,0.019854378
Have you ever owned a Iguana? I recently got a female and a male. They can vary in length based on the gender,0.07371122
No way I am so scared of iguanas do you play or hold them?,0.081625134
O let them sit in a tree most of the time and they love it. I just learned that they have a third eye and it senses light,0.20195828
Where is the third eye located?,0.030388435
It is on the top of the head,0.1104733
Wow at the top so they actually don't need that one most likely, what kind of things do they feed off of?,0.031213367
The mostly eat bugs, But the third eye looks like a pale scale and it can only make out light nothing else.,0.10175867
So that is how they determine the time of the day from that eye, what kind of bugs like crickets or flies?,0.054037213
Yeah in the wild im sure they hunt small rodents as well. The come from south America and the carribbean,0.06817148
I seen pictures of iguanas in the Caribbean and those things look big as dogs lol I would be to scared.,0.20009702
I have 2 pet Iguanas!,0.049831573
Are they green iguanas or lesser Antilles Iguanas?,0.013382856
Mine are the Antilles Iguanas. Do you have Iguanas?,0.023906821
No, i would never have Iguanas as a pet. they are way too much trouble to care for.,0.11912931
Hmm, what makes you say that?,0.01847211
About 70% of Iguanas in captivity die as a result of bad diet, poor lighting, and other housing conditions.  If i were to get one, it would be a blue iguana.,0.09915545
Yes, you do have to give them good care especially since they are in decline. I am hoping mine will mate! Blue Iguanas are beautiful.,0.04735767
Yes, they are.  Blues can live the longest of any iguana, up to 69 years....talk about a lifetime pet.,0.027442247
Iguanas are so cool.   I have a few as pets.,0.03109552
Iguana is genus of herbivorous,0.24603334

It was described by Austrian naturalist,0.033806015
Thats cool.  DO you know if they make good pets?,0.02249265
It is a popular pet,0.07291982
Do they really slap their tails when they  feel threatened?,0.3286776
Yes. Behind their necks are small scales which resembles spokes,0.1996317
I have a pet iguana from Mexico! Not as cuddly as a dog, but I love him anyway. His name is Ignacio, Iggy for short.,0.049336795
Are Iguanas good pets? They sound pretty easy to care for.,0.03015274
Well, you have to be careful. Diet, lighting, and other housing for a green iguana like mine causes too many to die in captivity too soon.,0.1182615
What is the average lifespan for an iguana?,0.043399423
They can live to be up to 20 years old! Of course, that's if they're properly cared for.,0.034041706
Oh wow that's such a long life! I didn't know that.,0.025674535
I know! Another fun fact: they have this light-sensing organ that looks like a pale scale on the top of their head called the parietal eye. It senses brightness (not details, like a real eye!),0.17718399
That's interesting. Does it help them see in the dark?,0.021667719
I love Iguanas! I think they are so funny.,0.03309893
yeah. they are found mostly in the central and south american regions.,0.01608456
Well here in Florida they are quite common too,,0.021196328
While that is true, they are not native to the region. They are either brought from their natural habitat and/or bred there,0.039462693
I used to catch Iguanas growing up, but don't worry I would later release them unharmed (at least physically),0.2540519
Haha.. i think you know they vary greatly in length,0.056263726
Yes the really small ones seem pretty delicate and almost transparent.,0.03875561
true. by the way, the scales behind their necks are known as tuberculate scales,0.17718399
Interesting, and I think they can regrow their tail id they lose it, right?,0.0414203
there is a third eye on them, This light-sensing organ is known as the parietal eye,0.17371799
Have you ever seen an Iguana? They are herbivore lizards?,0.10653123
Oh yes ive seen them before, Ive always wanted one as a pet, But never had the proper cages or know how to take care of them.,0.031331215
That would be pretty cool. The iguana is native to tropical countries like South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.,0.020607091
Oh cool! I do see them all the time in the news, I hear they are an invasive species in certain places. Do you know how old iguanas live for?,0.0969861
Usually about 12 years. The small scale behind the iguanas ears that look like spokes are called tuberculate scales.,0.05354243
Oh ok thats not so bad then, How big do iguanas get? Id liek to maybe get one that doesnt grow too big.,0.051810697
Iguanas range in length including the tail. Some males can get over 5ft in length,0.053295042
Over 5 feet! thats insane! I'm not sure I ever seen one that long before. Do you happen to know if iguanas are good around kids, do they bite?,0.17025198
Im not to sure. Ive just studied wild ones. The iguana also has a pale scale on their head that can sense light brightness.,0.04315203
Oh ok and thats pretty fascinating, What else do you know about iguanas?,0.049336795
I love Iguanas, I have a few as pets. Do you like lizards at all?,0.067380086
Yes, I like them. They are interesting.and prehistoric looking.  I like turtles too.,0.023906821
I agree, they definitely have a prehistoric look to them. There are also over 6000 species spread across the world.,0.022728346
Do they have teeth and does their bite hurt if they bite you?,0.200795
My Iguanas have teeth but they have never bitten me. I don't think it would hurt terribly because mine are small. Iguanas can vary in length though.,0.040183347
Do you let them run around the house and do they get along with other animals?,0.113263406
I don't let them run around the house, usually they stay in their container instead. Occasionally my friend brings her dog and they seem to get along when I bring them out briefly.,0.040183347
What do they eat? I've heard they need warmth and a lot of sunlight.,0.028856417
Iguanas are lizards native to central america and the caribbean.,0.14429577
