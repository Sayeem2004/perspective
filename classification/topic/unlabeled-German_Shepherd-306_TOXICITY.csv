Solid white shepherds look amazing, but I would probably go with the classic beige and black colors.,0.10566349
I love german shepherds, although I've never had one. You?,0.09568449
I have owned a German Shepherd. Though the person I purchased her from called it an Alsatian since they were from Ireland.  It was a great dog but was overly protective with my kids against their friends.,0.079250954
That's interesting.  At first I read that as German Shepherds are from Ireland. lol I can understand the concern with kids around.,0.112540044
Yeah, we had to train her better but its just her protective herding instinct.  German Shepherd are working dogs bred for herding sheep but instead she herded my kids!,0.1460314
Haha! Well, that can be helpful you know.  But not the roughing up their playmates.  Still, my understanding is that they are very smart dogs, very loyal.  iirc they have some problems with hip displasia right?,0.14256015
They are so intelligent but yes, that is one downside to that breed; hip problems.  I actually had a White Shepherd which is the same as a German Shepherd but just different coat colors.,0.2191003
Oh that sounds really striking.  Beautiful.  Did you raise it as a puppy or adopt an older dog?,0.10089093
We rescued it as a puppy.  She was gorgeous!  She passed away 4 years ago.  Her breed wasn't recognized by the United Kennel Club until year 1999.  Although I never showed her in an event. She would've won!,0.012691722
Hello, I just got done walking my dogs, What about you?,0.063423134
That is nice i have a German shepherd too. He is is a very good dog.,0.05750068
I have four. I train them for a living. They are my favorite breed,,0.051810697
I love everything about the German shepherd . especially about their origin.,0.19599396
Did you send yours to have them trained yet? What do you know about their origin?,0.0466155
They all come from  Alsatian in Britain and Ireland.,0.031213367
Oh wow. That's fascinating! I wonder why they were first used by policemen.,0.024378212
Have you ever heard about the pow pow. It is a kind of social gathring,0.041915078
No, Can you explain what that is?,0.008796243
It is held by different native american citizens,0.022021262
What is the purpose and reason for these gatherings?,0.01608456
I love dogs - German Shepherds are my favorite!  I own 4!  Are you a dog person?,0.051068526
Yes, I also love dogs. The German Shepherd is a new breed of dog, right? I think they have only been around since 1899.,0.05230548
Really?  I didn't know that!  I wonder who discovered them?  They are so affectionate!,0.015079274
I'm not sure who discovered them, but I know they were bred specifically to herd sheep.,0.23812068
Mine love to try to herd the cats and the kids.  They are so gentle with both, it's amazing.,0.18079062
They also are easily trained, obedient, and intelligent. Because of this, they are often used for disability assistance and for police work.,0.05378982
I have seen a lot used as police dogs.  I thought because of their sense of smell.,0.2540519
I'd imagine that was helpful too, especially as the other breeds used are Rottweilers and Belgian Malinois,0.12520397
Rottweilers scare me, though!  I've never heard of Belgian Malinois?,0.11378009
The Malinois can also be referred to as a Belgian Shepherd. I believe they are very similar to German Shepherds.,0.08795626
German Shepherd's sound scary with their domed forehead, long square-cut muzzles with strong jaws and a black nose, but they are just so cute!,0.2763787
I prefer a Bernese Mountain Dog or Caucasian Shepherd, but German Shepherds are popular in the United States.,0.104361884
Oh cool! I heard Bernese Mountain Dogs are one of the four breeds of Sennenhund-type dogs from the Swiss Alps.,0.036162965
They are nice dogs and good around children, but they will eat you into the poorhouse.,0.27975297
Yes I would imagine, with such a large dog! My Siberian Husky does the same.,0.04711028
Yes, Huskys are intelligent.  But if you have animals you need to protect, there is nothing like a Caucasian Shepherd.  Well, you could get a LLama.,0.1373533
Very intelligent she is. I've heard Caucasian Shepherd's are very strong and even-tempered so I would imagine. I would take anything over a Llama, I don't need to get spit at again!,0.26859093
LOL, i know what you mean.  My understanding is that the Incas kept LLamas for their surefootedness on mountain slopes, but they probably helped watch over the Alpacas as well.s,0.032391842
Yes! Llamas are actually really smart though, aside from that. they can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions.,0.08953904
Don't forget that you can shear them for their wool.  Some of the Alpacas the Incas kept provided the finest wool and clothes in the world, they still do up until today.,0.026735162
Have you ever met a German Shepherd? My uncle always had one growing up. They're so big and smart.,0.05131592
I haven't but they look like great dogs. I know they are often used as working dogs and originated in Germany,0.10653123
Yep they sure are. I can't spell it but they compete in a competition that has 3 parts. Scentwork, obedience and protection. The protection is where the guys dress up in the funny suits.,0.07054565
oh that always looks scary!  I read that the breed was once known as the  Alsatian in Britain and Ireland,0.077668175
I heard that too. I think that was because of World War 2? Im not sure, but i think they changed the name to avoid the negative association.,0.030034892
Also apparently the German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog with their orgin dating back to 1899,0.081625134
Yeah I heard that too, but I can't remember all of the founder breeds that were used.,0.034277402
I'm not sure either.  They were originally developed to herd sheep so that is why they are a part of the Herding Group,0.17458448
Yeah, and since they were a herding dog, I think that is why white is considered a fault. Since theyre the same color as the sheep.,0.4269174
Yes, now they are used for all types of work including disability, search and rescue, police work, military work, and even acting,0.0201057
