my daughter loves the animated tv show/movie from Hasbro known as My Little Pony,0.022964042
Oh haha, I used to watch that when I was younger,0.04760506
yes it was first developed to appeal to the target demo of young girls and theier parents,0.044883765
Interesting, did you enjoy watching it with your daughter, than?,0.2028889
yes the humorous and ironic concept of the show has developed a deeper appreciation for the show far beyond its original concept.,0.02968135
Oh I see, do you still watch it?,0.031449065
Well the show has reeived praise from television critics and parental groups however I dont anymore,0.019351736
Oh interesting! Do they still make it?,0.017341165
Have you ever watched "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"?,0.022610499
You mean the animated television series produced by hasbro? I have never watched it but I think it was tied in with a new launch of dolls and toys in 2010.,0.0143253105
It really is incredible. I consider myself female "Brony". You should give it a shot.,0.3561489
Have you ever attending Bronycon? It is an annual fan convention held on the east coast for adult and teenage fans of the show.,0.011623607
I haven't but I would absolutely love to. Bronies are actually a lot of fun and very intelligent, but they get a bad rap.,0.11652588
Why do they get a bad rap, is it because A brony Tale? the documentary from 2014 directed by Brent Hodge?,0.075294
I don't know. I haven't seen that documentary, but people think they're weird because they are grown men that like a kid's show. But the show is actually very complex.,0.06065326
Yeah it seems that that is what Bronies like about the show, the fandom surely found a deeper appreciation for the show far beyond the initial impression. It's endearing.,0.016587202
I think so too. And I think it's healthy for men to like things that are cutesy and sweet.,0.050326355
Yeah most of the fans did end up being mostly male, and ended up being drawn to the shows characters and stories. The show did eventually become a bit of an internet meme though.,0.06896287
Are you familiar with My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic?,0.040183347
yes, it is an  animated television series produced by Hasbro as part of the "My Little Pony" toy franchise,0.022964042
I was obsessed when I was little! I still have my collection of the toys.,0.045378547
The producer of the show also produced The Powerpuff Girls" and "Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends". She definitely knows what kids love :),0.01859777
You're kidding! She is a genius! : ) My Little Pony has been around for many years.,0.028502874
Lauren Faust wanted to knock off old ways and she  developed the show to appeal to the target demographic of young girls and their parents,,0.054037213
Well, good job by her. I wonder if the show is also shown in other countries. I know it has been a huge commercial success here in the US.,0.012880214
Of course, especially with the internet. in 2010 &  2011, the show grew an amazing huge group of followers online,0.017341165
I'm sure if I have daughters some day, they will love it. It's the perfect show for the ages of about 4 to 7.,0.038048524
It would surprise you to know that the followers were mostly male,0.11652588
I  enjoy My Little Pony..Have you seen the animated tv show?,0.030388435
I haven't personally but I know it has a pretty big following. What is it about?,0.022728346
It involves characters that challenge the "stereotypical norms of "girly". It adds humor and adventure as well.,0.034041706
That is good. I think it is important to let kids choose their personalities on their specific interests and not society's norms. Is the show just for kids?,0.015833238
I think it is mainly just for kids, but it has received praise from tv critics and parents!,0.018095128
That's good to know. What are some other qualities the show has?,0.013697007
Well it was base on a Hasbro toy franchise, so it has parallels to the play sets that exist.,0.0126288915
Pretty smart move by any company to have something like that. Maybe I'll catch an episode next time it is on!,0.019226074
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom is  an animated television series produced by Hasbro,0.03109552
I've heard of it, I think the popularity is tied between the brand and quality writing and show design.,0.013320025
The series was tied in with the 2010 launch of dolls and play sets, and original programming for U.S. cable channel Discovery Family,0.0038169413
Seems like strategic planning on their part, Lauren Faust was also selected as the creative developer.,0.0126288915
Under Hasbro's guidance, Faust developed the show to appeal to the target demographic of young girls and their parents,0.06025757
I agree, and think that she has made characters that challenge norms of typically "girly" images.,0.09741997
It also found an unlikely audience in a large group of adult Internet users in late 2010 and early 2011,0.007099825
Yes, I have heard that these fans are called brony or bronies.,0.10045706
yes and ha's because mostly male, were drawn to the show's characters,0.071337044
I find it so interesting that despite it's roots as a toy tie-in, the adult interest in the show is compared to sponge bob and others.,0.034041706
I am a pretty big fan of my little pony. It's so cute!,0.032863233
I've heard of this animated series before. Is it produced by Hasbro?,0.02402467
I think it might be. Do you know much about my little pony?,0.032863233
I know it launched in 2010 will dolls and play sets.,0.025203144
Is it really that old already? Wow! What kind of my little pony play sets are there?,0.0926474
Im not sure but it found an audience with adult internet users after its launch.,0.01237757
Yes it got pretty popular. Do you know the characters from my little pony? I like the blue pony!,0.02543884
I dont know their names, but the adult fans call themselves bronies. A combo of bro and pony.,0.165053
I love watching My LIttle Pony: Friendship Magic fandom. It's an animated series that is part of the My little Pony toy franchise.,0.020607091
My sister really liked those.  It's so neat that all that stuff is coming back now.,0.028502874
It is neat. This is the fourth generation (G4) of the franchise.,0.011812098
Wow, I was thinking maybe the 2nd.  Then you've got Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake, etc..,0.018095128
I think it's funny that fans are called bronies (previous fans were mostly males so they combined bro and pony),0.12867521
That is weird that males liked them - I wonder why.,0.063027434
For some reason they were drawn to the character's, stories, animation style. They formed their own little subculture. It is pretty weird for sure.,0.051068526
That is just so odd to me - I can't see my husband or any grown man that I know being interested in that.  Well to each their own I guess.,0.023317585
I think Lauren Faust has done a good job as creative developer and executive producer. She also had experience on the Powerpuff Girls. My kids used to like that show too.,0.015958898
So the same person did both My Little Pony and the Powerpuff Girls?,0.03309893
I like MLP,  "" is an animated television series produced by Hasbro,0.022846194
Oh nice, what is your favorite aspect about MLP?,0.02249265
I like the art of it.  Lauren Faust was selected as the creative developer and executive producer for the show,0.02107848
Very cool, so my little pony isn't just for children?,0.034041706
Not anymore, Under Hasbro's guidance, Faust developed the show to appeal to the target demographic of young girls and their parents,0.06025757
Oh wow, that gives me some hope for when I am a parents. Who is your favorite character on my little pony?,0.050078966
I think its the apple girl. It also found an unlikely audience in a large group of adult Internet users in late 2010,0.027913637
That is very interesting. I wonder what draws them to the show.,0.015644746
I USED TO BE A FAN OF MY LITTLE PONY,0.05378982
I use to follow the series on television but I stopped for a long while,0.027442247
IT WAS SO SWEET AND FILLED WITH MAGIC.,0.030859824
That is true. I even bought some animated character for my son,0.02035702
I HAD A WHITE PONY WITH A SHINY LONG TAIL, IN PINK, IT THINK.,0.083999306
My son liked the pony and plays with it most of the time,0.045131154
I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL RECENTLY, THAT IT'S A HASBRO PRODUCTION.,0.039935954
Yes that is true. Hasbro produced the television series on tv,0.017089844
So there is a big group based on the fandom of my little pony,0.083999306
My Little Pony is based on the toy franchise based on dolls and play sets. It aired on Discovery Family. What is the name of this fan group?,0.021549871
Friendship is Magic.  It is actually mostly for adults and cosplayers,0.057005897
It was a tv series based on My Little Pony and it also aired on Discovery Family. Do they have events and get togethers?,0.0154562555
They have conventions.  One of the major ones is called BronyCon.,0.03545588
So BronyCon meets annually in the United States for fans of the show.,0.01847211
Yes.  It is on the east coast.  Brony stands for bro and pony,0.06263174
There have been eight events with one that had over 7600 attendees. Since brony stands for BRO, does this mean most of the fans are male?,0.04290464
Yes.  The term was popularized on 4Chan.  It surprised the makers of the show that they had attracted an audience of adult males to the show,0.024142517
So 4chan is a forum where the users mostly post anonymously.,0.03192045
My Little Pony is definitely a kids show but a lot of adults seem to love it too.,0.027442247
I didnt like the fandom for it.,0.06381883
Yeah I just can't see how anybody above the age of 10 could enjoy their dolls and play sets as well as the show.,0.07291982
yea its kind of crazy and weird it was really uncomfortable.,0.28857216
Yeah adults should really not watch the show or play with any toys in general at that age, especially for My Little Pony.,0.050573748
Yea only kids should stick to MLP.,0.051068526
The toys are for girls too, so the adult men creep me out the most. The toys are made by Hasbro.,0.15822013
Yeaaaa not worth to dive into all of that, pretty awful.,0.2854903
Do you like My Little Pony?,0.045378547
of course. I'm a huge fan of Lauren Faust, its creative director. she also did Powerpuff Girls, another great show,0.026263772
I was unaware of that. I grew up watching Powerpuff Girls, but I can't say I'm an MLP fan. Can you fill me in on its concept and fandom?,0.03357032
well, it's meant for young girls and their parents....meant for.......,0.032863233
Yeah, I know a bit about the spread of the fandom. I still don't see the appeal for those outside of the target audience.,0.023671126
yeah around 2010 or 2011 suddenly there was a huge amount of adult men on the internet who loved it,0.04760506
Some websites even decided to ban it outright, or form a "containment board" where it was MLP only and any MLP posts outside that board would be deleted and result in a ban,0.02920996
yeah the "bronies" as they're called are a weird group indeed,0.22846605
Luckily I know none in real life. Or so I think.,0.032627538
you should watch Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony (what a mouthful) if you want to be creeped out even more! haha it's a good documentary,0.20009702
I was just admiring my neighbors collection of My Little Pony things - they are just beautiful!,0.020607091
My Little Pony is an animated television series,0.023906821
I didn't know there was a tv show too!  I just thought there were just the dolls and figurines - a tv show sounds awesome!,0.025203144
The show is praised from critics and parental groups alike!,0.012817383
Really??  Wow, I will definitely watch it then!  I'm sure I will love it!,0.02107848
It comes on discovery family channel,0.029917045
Awesome, I get that channel!  I am excited now to watch it!  I'll make popcorn!,0.04290464
Don't become a brony!!!!,0.31132057
My daughter loves my little pony but I think it's cute too. A lot of parental groups aprove of the show,0.04760506
I can't say I have ever watched it, but I have seen a lot of people talk about it online.,0.027324399
In 2010 they had a relaunch but in 2017 My Little Pony released a movie,0.019100413
To be honest, the 'brony subculture' online has really turned me off to the show, so I haven't really paid attention to it.,0.06500591
I thinks it's crazy how much money was raised for Brony. It was way more than even they expected,0.11739369
I'm not really sure I know who you're talking about?  I was talking about the adult men who watch my little pony, they call them 'Bronies'.,0.06263174
There was a film made about it. Even a BronyCon in 2012,0.022610499
Have you ever attended one of the conventions?,0.016838523
No, I haven't. The BronyCon is held each year on the east coast but I'm not that big of a fan,0.021314176
Ah.  Gotcha.  Me either.  What does your daughter like about it?,0.044141594

My Little Pony: Friendship is an animated show for kids but its very popular amoung adults for some reason,0.05131592
Well, I have a 5 year olf and a 3 year old little girl. We watch a LOT of My Little Pony, I just wasn't sure if it was the same show. That would be amazing if a new one was out. BTW, not to judge but I would be highly creeped out if a group of adults watched it alone lol,0.10913446
My Little Pony: Friendship has a huge adult fandom for some reason and it is creepy even though its a show based off the hasbro toy,0.16245349
Oh yeah. Probably that one then. Does it have Spike, Discord, Rainbow Dash ect? Discord is a bad guy but he's my favorite,0.11150667
My Little Pony: Friendship has all of those characters and has been around since 2019,0.028149333
I watched it as a kid, I don't remember discord though. Not on a show anyway, childhood was another story my friend,0.027913637

Personally not so much as I have a son not a daughter! But I know it does com on the Discovery family channel network often,0.033334624
Nice :),0.01646154
Funny fact for you, it is a show for little girls, but there is a group of male adult fans who decided to create a subculture out of it in 2010,0.11398677
I don't know about that. Interesting,0.01633588
Yes they call themselves Brony. Its a combination of Bro and Pony. Hahahah,0.11388343
Apparently this My Little Pony is a bit of a cultural phenomenon these days.,0.043399423
Actually, the TV series is tied in to a product launch of dolls and play sets.,0.01646154

I know about the toy dolls I didn't know if they were connected to the show, that's pretty cool!,0.02449606
Yeah.  My little Pony has been cool since the 80s.,0.017843807
I only knew about the recent show and that is because of how rabid its fanbase is!,0.17025198
My Little Pony first came out in 1982.  Unreal how long it has been around.,0.013571346

But the ponies did have attractive colorful bodies and a unique symbol that allowed the children to pick an individual favorite.,0.013697007
Yeah, and now they've come back around again - along with Strawberry Shortcake.,0.027677942
I love strawberry shortcake. That crumbly bread is delicious.,0.023317585
