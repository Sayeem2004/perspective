Ah they must have been around for a while since there have been sheep herders for forever there! Was the book Lassie about a border collie?,0.09785384
No it was not. The Border Collie is usually a medium sized dog so I can see how you could mix that up.,0.061444655
Oh I see. Do border collies have anything else they're especially known for being good at in addition to herding sheep?,0.15711457

My border collie was never taught to herd she knew how instinctively,0.09438288
It takes a highly energetic breed such as yours to successfully herd.,0.27525392
She is very good at it its almost like its her purpose in life she enjoys it,0.091913216
For a medium size dog, their coat sure does shed a lot !,0.11336674

Yes, I have a Border Collie. They were developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region my home country.,0.031684756
Wow, what a coincidence I remember having a Border Collie growing up and many other type of animals. They are very mild-mannered dogs.,0.0969861

Careful, my vet claimed that there is no basis to the claims that certain dog breeds are hypoallergenic,0.05280026
I love my Border Collies! They are such a great breed, known for their obedience and intelligence.,0.032863233

Whats the downside of owning a Border Collie?,0.028385026
They shed a ton! Even they're medium sized dogs, they shed a lot because of their super thick coats. I'm constantly vacuuming! Do your Great Danes shed?,0.091913216
Holy cow yes! I swear everytime you pet him you could make a coat out of the fur that falls off its kind of ridiculous, its not to bad this time of year once it starts to get cold again, but its really bad at the end of winter.,0.37751234
Haha! Just like my dogs. My dogs are both black and white, which is the most commonly seen color for their breed. So at least it's easy to spot the fur on the floor!,0.10609736
Its the other way around for me, My Dog has brown fur and we have brown carpet, so it just means we have to vacuum 2 or 3 times a week, especially the couches, as he thinks hes a small dog and uses the couch as a bed.,0.032391842
Border collies are one of the best dogs in my opinion, i recently had one pass away at the age of 13,0.03875561

why would you want a border collie, do you own sheep?,0.11429678
Haha, no sheep - I just like collies a lot. I guess they were bred because they were so intelligent and obedient, which sounds about right to me.,0.09958932
