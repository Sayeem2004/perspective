I like some of his music. He was the first to have seven songs form a debut record chart on the Billboard Hot 100. He might have been too young, I agree.,0.0201057
Yes, he's had several songs top the charts. I believe he's actually fluent in French. I'm surprised by that!,0.02685301
I liked his first full length studio album My World 2.0 that came out in 2010,0.020231359

I agree, he has some really good music and its cool that he is the same age as me (born in 1994) but he's made some careless mistakes,0.06025757
He has. But, I guess it's hard to stay on track when you become as rich and famous as he has at such an early age. But, he can sing pretty good.,0.02402467
I wish I knew if it was or wasn't but Ill never be that rich so Ill never know! Yes, in the US he was certified as platinum,0.07054565
I will never be that rich either. Did you know he cut his hair once and sold it on ebay for $12,000?!?! Isn't that crazy!,0.36095104
No I did not, thats insane! I wonder who would even want to buy hair. and what they would do with it.. anyway lol he was actually discovered through youtube, which is interesting,0.1893425
Yes, I didn't know that! Maybe the person that bought the hair hoped they could clone him and keep for themselves lol. He actually can speak French fluently.... I would have never thought that!,0.07845957

Oh of course, I think everyone in America has heard them! I liked his earlier work before he became a celebrity gone wild!,0.09481675

Yes! That;s one of my favorites! I'm sure many people enjoy that song!,0.019351736
It's a certified banger. And though I love his early work as well, there is something impressive about being featured on the "Despacito" remix. It was a worldwide smash.,0.07371122
